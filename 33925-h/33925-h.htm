<div class="caption2">PREFACE</div>

<p>No better district could be chosen to begin the study of
Geology than the Isle of Wight. The splendid coast
sections all round its shores, the variety of strata within
so small an area, the great interest of those strata, the
white chalk cliffs and the coloured sands, the abundant
and interesting fossils to be found in the rocks, awaken
in numbers of those who live in the Island, or visit its
shores, a desire to know something of the story written
in the rocks. The Isle of Wight is classic ground of
Geology. From the early days of the science it has been
made famous by the work of great students of Nature,
such as Mantell, Buckland, Fitton, Sedgwick, Owen,
Edward Forbes, and others, who have carried on the study
up to the present day. Many of the strata are known to
geologists everywhere as typical; several bear the names
of the Island localities, where they occur; some&mdash;and
those not the least interesting&mdash;are not found beyond the
limits of the Island. Though studied for so many years,
there is no exhausting their interest: new discoveries are
constantly made, and new questions arise for solution.
To those who have become interested in the rocks of the
Island, and the fossils they have found in them, and who
wish to learn how to read the story they tell, and to know
something of that story, this book is addressed. It is intended
to be an introduction to the science of Geology,
based on the Geology of the Isle of Wight, yet leading
on to some glimpse of the history presented to us, when
we take a wider outlook still, and try to trace the whole
wondrous path of change from the world's beginning to
the present day.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_iv" id="Page_iv">[Pg&nbsp;iv]</a></span>
I wish to express my warmest thanks to Miss Maud Neal
for the beautiful drawings of fossils which illustrate the
book, and to Professor Grenville A. J. Cole, F.R.S., for his
kindness in reading the manuscript, and for valuable
suggestions received from him. I have also to acknowledge
my indebtedness to Mr. H. J. Osborne White's new edition
of the <i>Memoir of the Geological Survey of the Isle of Wight</i>,
1921; and to thank Mr. J. Milman Brown, of Shanklin,
for the three photographs of Island scenery, showing
features of marked geological interest, and Mr. C. E.
Gilchrist, Librarian of the Sandown Free Library, for
kindly reading the proofs of the book.</p>

<div class="chapt_hdr">Chapter I</div>
<div class="chapt_ttl">THE ROCKS AND THEIR STORY</div>


<p>Walking along the sea shore, with all its varied interest,
many must from time to time have had their attention
attracted by the shells to be seen, not lying on the sands,
or in the pools, but firmly embedded in the solid rock of
the cliffs and of the rock ledges which run out on to the
shore, and have, it may be, wondered sometimes how they
got there. At almost any point of the coast of the Isle
of Wight, in bands of limestone and beds of clay, in cliffs
of sandstone or of chalk, we shall have no difficulty in
finding numerous shells. But it is not only in the rocks
of the sea coast that shells are to be found. In quarries
for building stone and in the chalk pits of the downs we
see shells in the rock, and may often notice them in the
stones of walls and buildings. How did they get there?
The sea, we say, must once have been here. It must
have flowed over the land at some time. Now let us
think. We are going to read a wonderful story, written
not in books, but in the rocks. And it will be much more
valuable if we learn to read it ourselves, than if we are
just told what other people have made out. We know a
thing much better if we see the answers to questions for
ourselves than if we are told the answers, and take some
one else's word for it. And if we learn to ask questions
of Nature, and get answers to them, it will be useful in
all sorts of ways all through life. Now, look at the shells
in the rock of cliff and quarry. How are they there?
The sea cannot have just flowed over and left them. The
rock could not have been hard, as it is now, when they
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_2" id="Page_2">[Pg&nbsp;2]</a></span>
got in. Some of the rocks are sandstone, much like the
sand on the sea shore, but they are harder, and their
particles are stuck together. Does sand on a sea shore
ever become hard like rock, so that shells buried in it are
found afterwards in hard rock? Now we are getting the
key to a secret. We are learning the way to read the
story of the rocks. How? In this way. Look around
you. See if anything like this is happening to-day. Then
you will be able to read the story of what happened long,
long ago, of how this world came to be as it is to-day.
We have asked a question about the sandstone. What
about the clays and the limestone? As before, what is
happening to-day? Is limestone being made anywhere
to-day, and are shells being shut up in it? Are shells in
the sea being covered up with clay,&mdash;with mud,&mdash;and more
shellfish living on the top of that; and then, are they, too,
being covered up? So that in years to come they will
be found in layers of clay and stone like those we have
been looking at in quarry and sea cliff?</p>

<p>We have asked our questions. Now we must look
around, and see if we can find the answers. After it has
been raining heavily for two or three days go down to
the marshes of the Yar, and stand on one of the bridges
over the stream. We have seen it flowing quite clear on
some days. Now it is yellow or brown with mud. Where
did the mud come from? Go into a ploughed field with
a ditch by the side. Down the ditch the rain water is
pouring from the field away to the stream. It is thick
with mud. Off the ploughed field little trickles of water
are running into the ditch. Each brings earth from the
field with it. Off all the country round the rain is trickling
away, carrying earth into the ditches and on into the
stream, and the stream is carrying it down into the sea.
Now think. After every shower of rain earth is carried
off the land into the sea. And this goes on all the year
round, and year after year. If it goes on long enough&mdash;?
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_3" id="Page_3">[Pg&nbsp;3]</a></span>
Look a long way ahead, a hundred years,&mdash;a thousand,&mdash;thousands
of years. We shall be talking soon of what
takes many thousands of years to do. Why, you say, if
it goes on long enough, all the land will be carried into
the sea. So it will be. So it must be. You see how the
world is changing. You will soon see how it has changed
already, what wonderful changes there have been. You
will see that things have happened in the world which
you never guessed till you began to study Geology.</p>

<p>Now, let us go a bit further. What becomes of all the
mud the streams and rivers are carrying down into the
sea? Look at a stream coming steeply down from the
hills. How it rushes along, rolling pebbles against one
another, sweeping everything before it, clearing out its
channel, polishing the rocks, and carrying all it rubs off
down towards the sea. Now look at a river near its mouth
in flat lowland country. It flows now much slower; and
so it has not power to bear along all the material it swept
down from the hills. And so it drops a great deal; it is
always silting up its own channel, and in flood time
depositing fresh layers of mud on the flat meadow land,&mdash;the
alluvial flat,&mdash;through which it generally flows in the
last part of its course. But a good deal of sediment is
carried by the river out to sea. The water of the river,
moving slower as it enters the sea, has less and less power
to sweep along its burden of sand and mud, and it drops
it on the sea bottom,&mdash;first the bigger coarser particles
like the sand, then the mud; farther out, the finer particles
of mud drop to the bottom.</p>

<p>During the exploring cruise of the <i>Challenger</i>, under the
direction of Sir Wyville Thomson, in 1872-6, the most
extensive exploration of the depths of the sea that has
been made up to the present time, it was found that
everything in the nature of gravel or sand was laid down
within a very few miles, only the finer muddy sediments
being carried as far as 20 to 50 miles from the land, the
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_4" id="Page_4">[Pg&nbsp;4]</a></span>
very finest of all, under most favourable conditions, rarely
extending beyond 150, and never exceeding 300 miles
from land into the deep ocean. So gradually layer after
layer of sand and mud cover the sea bed round our coasts;
and shells of cockles and periwinkles, of crabs and sea
urchins, and other sea creatures that have lived on the
bottom of the sea are buried in the growing layers of
sand and mud. As layer forms on layer, the lower layers
are pressed together, and become more and more solid.
And so we have got a good way towards seeing the making
of clay and sandstone with shells in them, such as we
saw in the sea cliffs and the quarries.</p>

<p>But it is not only rain and rivers that are wearing the
land away. All round the coasts the sea is doing the
same work. We see the waves beating against the shores,
washing out the softer material, hollowing caves into the
cliffs, eating away by degrees even the hardest rock, leaving
for a while at times isolated rocks like the Needles to
mark the former extension of the land. Most people see
for themselves the work of the sea, but do not notice so
much what the rain and the frost, the streams and the
rivers are doing. But these are wearing away the ground
over the whole country, while the sea is only eating away
at the coast line. So the whole of the land is being worn
away, and the sand and mud carried out into the sea, and
deposited there, the material of new land beneath the
waters.</p>

<p>How do these beds rise up again, so that we find them
with their sea shells in the quarry? Well, we look at the
sea heaving up and down with the tides, and we think of
the land as firm and fixed. And yet the land also is continually
heaving up and down&mdash;very slowly,&mdash;far too
slowly for it to be noticed, but none the less surely. The
exact causes of this are not yet well understood, because
we know but little about the inside of the earth. The
deepest mine goes a very little way. We know that parts
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_5" id="Page_5">[Pg&nbsp;5]</a></span>
of the interior are intensely hot. The temperature in a
mine becomes hotter, about 1&deg;F. for every 60&nbsp;ft. we go
down on the average. We know that there are great
quantities of molten rock in places, which, in a volcanic
eruption is poured out in sheets of lava over the land.
There are great quantities of water turned into steam by
the heat, and in an eruption the steam pours out of the
crater of the volcano like the clouds of steam out of the
funnel of a locomotive. The people who live about a
volcano are living, as it were, on the top of the boiler of
a steam engine; and their country is sometimes shaken
up and down like the lid of a kettle by the escaping steam.
In such a country the land is often changing its level.
A few miles from Naples at Pozzuoli, the ancient Puteoli,
may be seen columns of what appears to be an ancient
market hall, though it goes by the name of the Temple
of Serapis. About half way up the columns are holes
bored by boring shellfish, such as we may find on the shore
here at low tide. We see from this that since the building
was constructed in Roman times the land has sunk, and
carried the columns into the sea, and shellfish have bored
into them. Then the land has risen, and lifted the columns
out of the sea again.</p>

<p>But it is not only in the neighbourhood of volcanoes
that the land is moving. Not suddenly and violently,
but slowly and gradually great tracts of land rise and sink.
Sometimes the land may remain for a long time nearly
stationary. The Southern coasts of England seem to
stand at much the same level as in the time of the
Romans 1,500 or 2,000 years ago. On the other hand there
is evidence which seems to show that the coast of Norway
has for some time been gradually rising.</p>

<p>It was thought at one time that the interior of the
earth was liquid like molten lava, and that the land we
see was a comparatively thin crust over this like the crust
of a pie. But it is now believed for various mathematical
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_6" id="Page_6">[Pg&nbsp;6]</a></span>
reasons, that the main mass of the earth is rigid as
steel. Still underneath the surface rocks there must
be a quantity of semi-fluid matter, like molten rock, and
on this the solid land sways about, as we see the ice on a
pond sway with the pressure of the skaters on it. So the
solid land, pressed by internal forces, rises and falls like
the elastic ice, sometimes sinking and letting the sea flow
over, then rising again, and bringing up the land from
beneath the sea.</p>

<p>Again, as the heated interior of the earth gradually
cools by the radiation of the earth's heat into space, it
will tend to shrink away from the cooler rocks of the
crust. This then, sinking in upon the shrinking interior,
will be thrown into folds, like the skin on a shrivelled
apple. Seeing, as we often do, layers of rock thrown into
numerous folds, so as to occupy a horizontal space far less
than that in which they were originally laid down, we can
hardly resist the conclusion that shrinkage of the cooling
interior of the earth has been a chief cause of the greatest
movements of the surface, and of the lateral pressure we
so often find the strata to have undergone.</p>

<p>As we study geology we shall find plenty to show that
the land does rise and fall, that where now is land the
sea has been, that land once stretched where now is sea,
though there is still much which is not well understood
about the causes of its movements. We have seen how
many of the rocks are made in the sea,&mdash;the sandstones
and the clays,&mdash;but there are two other kinds of rocks,
about which we must say a little. The first are the
Igneous rocks, which means rocks made by fire. These
rocks have solidified, most frequently in crystalline forms,
from a molten mass. Lava, which flows hot and fluid,
from a volcano, and cooling becomes a sheet of solid rock,
is an igneous rock. Some igneous rocks solidify under
ground under great pressure, and become crystalline
rocks such as granite. We shall not find these rocks in
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_7" id="Page_7">[Pg&nbsp;7]</a></span>
the Isle of Wight. We should find them in Cornwall,
Wales, and Scotland; and, if we could go deep enough,
we should find some such rock as granite underneath the
other rocks all the world over. The other rocks, such as
the sandstones and clays, are called Sedimentary rocks,
because they are formed of sediment, material carried by
the sea and rivers, and dropped to the bottom. They
are also called Stratified rocks, because they are formed
of Strata, <i>i.e.</i>, beds or layers, as we see in cliff and
quarry.</p>

<p>But we have seen another kind of rock,&mdash;the limestones.
In Sandown Bay towards the Culvers, bands of limestone
run through the dark clay cliffs, and broken fragments lie
on the shore, looking like pieces of paving stone.
Examining these we find that they are made up of shells,
one band of small oysters, the others of shells of other
kinds. You see how they have been made. There has
been an oyster bed, and the shells have been pressed
together, and somehow stuck together, so that they have
formed a layer of rock. They are stuck together in this
way. The atmosphere contains a small quantity of
carbonic dioxide, and the soil a larger quantity, the result
of vegetable decomposition. Rain water absorbs some
of it, and carries it into the rocks, as it soaks into the
ground. This gas has the property of combining with
carbonate of lime,&mdash;the material of which shells and
limestone are made. The bicarbonate of lime so formed
is soluble in water, which is not the case with the simple
carbonate. Water containing carbonic dioxide soaking
into a limestone rock or a mass of shells dissolves some of
the carbonate of lime, and carries it on with it. When it
comes to an open space containing air, some of the
carbonic dioxide is given off, leaving the insoluble carbonate
of lime again. So by degrees the hollows are filled up, and
a solid layer of rock is formed. Even while gathering in
the sea the shell-fragments may be cemented by the
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_8" id="Page_8">[Pg&nbsp;8]</a></span>
deposit of carbonate of lime from sea-water containing
more of the soluble bicarbonate than it can hold.</p>

<p>These limestones are examples of rocks which are said
to be of organic origin, that is to say, they are formed by
living things. Organic rocks may be formed by animal
or vegetable growth. Rocks of vegetable origin are seen
in the coals. A peat bog is composed of a mass of vegetable
matter, chiefly bog moss, which for centuries has
been growing and accumulating on the spot. At the
bottom of the bog will frequently be found trunks of oak,
or other trees, the remains of a forest of former days. The
wood has undergone chemical changes, has lost much of
its moisture, and often become very hard, as in bog oak.
Beds of coal have been formed by a similar process, on a
much vaster scale, and continued much longer. The
remains of ancient forests have been buried under sand
stones and other rocks, have undergone chemical change,
and been compressed into the hard solid mass we call
coal. Fossil wood, which has not reached the stage of
hard coal, but forms a soft brown substance, is called
lignite. This is of frequent occurrence in various strata
in the Isle of Wight.</p>

<p>Of organic rocks of animal origin the most remarkable
are the chalk, of which we shall speak later, and the coral-reefs,
which are found in the warm waters of tropical seas.
Sailing over the South Pacific you will see a line of trees&mdash;coconut
trees chiefly&mdash;looking as if they rose up from the
sea. Coming nearer you see that they grow on a low
island, which rises only a few feet above the water. These
islands are often in the form of a ring, and look "like
garlands thrown upon the waters." Inside the ring is a
lagoon of calm water. Outside the heavy swell of the
Southern Ocean thunders on the coral shore. If a sounding
line be let down from the outer edge of the reef, it
will be found that the wall of coral goes down hundreds
of feet like a precipice. On an island in the Southern Sea,
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_9" id="Page_9">[Pg&nbsp;9]</a></span>
Funafuti, a deep boring has been made 1,114&nbsp;ft. deep.
As far as the boring went all was coral. All this mass of
coral is formed by living things,&mdash;polyps they are called.
They are like tiny sea anemones, only they grow attached
to one another, forming a compound animal, like a tree
with stem and branches, and little sea anemones for
flowers. The whole organism has a sort of shell or skeleton,
which is the coral. Blocks are broken off by the waves,
and ground to a coral mud, which fills up the interstices
of the coral; and as more coral grows above, the lower
part of the reef becomes, by pressure and cementing, a solid
coral limestone. Once upon a time there were coral
islands forming in a sea, where now is England. These
old coral reefs form beds of limestone in Devon, Derbyshire,
and other parts of England. In the Isle of Wight
we have no old coral reefs, but we shall easily find fossil
corals in the rocks. They helped to make up the rocks,
but there were not enough here to make reefs or islands
all of coral.</p>

<p>The great branching corals that form the reefs can only
live in warm waters. So we see that when corals were
forming reefs where now is England the climate must
have been warm like the tropics. That is a story we
shall often read as we come to hear more about the rocks.
We shall find that the climate has often been quite warm
as the tropics are now: and we shall also read another
wonderful story of a time when the climate was cold like
the Arctic regions.

<div class="chapt_hdr">Chapter II.</div>
<div class="chapt_ttl">THE STRUCTURE OF THE ISLAND.</div>

<p>The best place to begin the study of the Geology of the Isle
of Wight is in Sandown Bay. North of Sandown, beyond
the flat of the marshes, are low cliffs of reddish clay, which
has slipped in places, and is much covered by grass. At
low tide we shall see the coloured clays on the shore, unless
the sand has covered them up. Variegated marls they
are called&mdash;<i>marl</i> means a limy clay, <i>loam</i> a sandy clay;
and very fine are the colours of these marls, rich reds and
purples and browns. Beyond the little sea wall below
Yaverland battery we come to a different kind of clay
forming the cliff. It is in thin layers. Clay in thin
layers like this is called <i>shale</i>. Some of these shales are
known as paper shales, for the layers are thin almost like
the leaves of a book. The junction of the shales with the
marls is quite sharp, and we see that the shales rest on the
coloured marls, not horizontally, but sloping down towards
the North. Bands of limestone and sandstone running
through the shales, and a hard band of brown rock which
runs out on the shore as a reef, slope in the same direction.
As we pass on by the Red Cliff to the White Cliffs we
notice that the strata slope more steeply the further North
we go. We have seen that these strata were laid down
layer by layer at the bottom of the sea. If we find a lot
of things lying one on top of another, we may generally
conclude that the ones at the bottom were put there first,
then the next, and so on to the top. And this will
generally be true with regard to the rocks. The lowest
rocks must have been laid down first, then the next, and
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11">[Pg&nbsp;11]</a></span>
so on. But these layers of shale with shells in them, and
layers of limestone made of shells, must have been laid
down at first fairly flat on the sea floor; but as they
were upheaved out of the sea they have been tilted, so
that we now see them in an inclined position. And when
we come to the chalk, we should see, if we looked at the
end of the Culver Cliffs from a boat, that the lines of
black flints that run through the chalk are nearly vertical.
The strata there have been tilted up on end.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>In describing how strata lie, we call the inclination of
the strata from the horizontal the <i>dip</i>. The direction of
a horizontal line at right angles to that of the dip is called
the <i>strike</i>. If we compare the sloping strata to the roof
of a house, a line down the slope of the roof will mark the
direction of the dip, the ridge of the roof that of the strike.
The strata we are considering dip towards the North;
the line of strike is East and West.</p>

<p>Returning towards Sandown we see the strata dipping
less and less steeply, till near the Granite Fort the rocks
on the shore are horizontal. Continuing our walk past
Sandown to Shanklin we pass the same succession of rocks
we have been looking at, but in reverse order, and sloping
the other way. It is not very easy to see this at first, for
so much is covered by building; but beyond Sandown we
see Sandstone Cliffs like the Red Cliff again, the strata
dipping gently now to the south, and in the downs above
Shanklin we see the chalk again. So we have the same
strata north and south of Sandown, forming a sort of
arch. But the centre of the arch is missing. It must
have been cut away. We saw that the land was all being
eaten away by rain and rivers. Now we see what they
have done here. Go up on to the Downs, and look over
the central part of the Island. We see two ranges of
downs running from east to west,&mdash;the Central Downs of
the Island, a long line of chalk down 24 miles from the
Culver Cliff on the east to the Needles on the west; and
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">[Pg&nbsp;12]</a></span>
the Southern Downs along the South Coast from
Shanklin to Chale. In the Central Downs the chalk
rises nearly vertically, and turns over in the beginning
of an arch towards the South. Then comes a big gap,
and the chalk appears again in the Southern Downs
nearly horizontal, sloping gently to the south. The
chalk was once joined right across the central hollow,
where now we see the villages of Newchurch, Godshill,
and Arreton. All that enormous mass of rock that once
filled the space between the downs has been cut away by
running water.</p>

<p>An arch of strata like this <img src="images/cap.png" width="12" height="12" border="0" alt="cap" title="anticline" />, such as the one we are
looking at, is called an <i>anticline</i>. When the arch is reversed,
like this <img src="images/cup.png" width="12" height="12" border="0" alt="cup" title="syncline" />, it is called a <i>syncline</i>. Looking north
from the Central Downs over the Solent we are looking
at a syncline. The chalk, which dips down at the Culvers
and along the line of the Central Downs, runs like a trough
under the Solent, and rises again, as we see it on the other
side, in the Portsdown Hills.</p>

<p>We might suppose the top of an anticlinal arch would
be the highest part of the country; that, even if rain
and running water have worn the country down, that
would still stand highest, and be worn down least. But
there are reasons why this need not be so. For one thing,
when the horizontal strata are curved over into an arch,
they naturally crack just at the top of the curve, so&nbsp;<img src="images/curve_2_v.png" width="62" height="12" border="0" alt="curve with two craks near top" title="curve with two craks near top" />&nbsp;and into the cracks the rain gets, and so a stream is
started there, which cuts down and widens its channel,
and so eats the land away. Again, the rising land only
emerges gradually from the sea, and the sea may cut off
the top of the arch before it has risen out of its reach.
Moreover on the higher land the fall of rain and snow is
greater, and the frosts are more severe; so that it is just
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13">[Pg&nbsp;13]</a></span>
there that the forces wearing down the land are most
effective.</p>

<p>We must notice another thing which happens when
rocks are being upheaved and bent into curves. The
strain is very great, and sometimes the strata crack and
one side is pushed up more than the other. These cracks
are called <i>faults</i>. At Little Stairs, about half way
between Sandown and Shanklin, two or three faults may
be seen in the cliff. The effect of two of the faults may
be easily seen by noticing the displacement of a band
of rock stained orange by water containing iron. The
strata are thrown down towards the north about 8&nbsp;ft.
A third fault, the effect of which is not so evident at first
sight, throws the strata down roughly 50&nbsp;ft. to the south.
These are only small faults, but sometimes faults occur,
in which the strata have been moved on opposite sides of
the fault thousands of feet away from one another. We
might think we should see a wall of rock rising up on the
surface of the ground where a fault occurs; but the faults
have mostly taken place ages ago; and, when they do
happen, the rocks are generally moved only a little way
at a time. Then after a while another push comes on the
rocks, and they shift again at the same place, and go a bit
further. All this time frost and rain and rivers are working
at the surface, and planing it down; so that the unevenness
of the surface caused by faults is smoothed away;
and so even a great fault does not show at the surface.</p>

<p>As we follow the Sandown anticline westward it gradually
dies away, the upheaved area being actually a long
oval&mdash;what we may call a turtle-back. As the Sandown
anticline dies out, it is succeeded by another a little
further south, the Brook anticline. There are in fact a
series of these east and west anticlines in the Island and
on the adjacent mainland, caused by the same earth
movement. As a consequence of the arching of the strata
we find the lowest beds we saw in Sandown Bay running
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">[Pg&nbsp;14]</a></span>
out again on the west of the Island in Brook Bay, and a
general correspondence of the strata on the east and west
of the Island; while, as we travel from Sandown or Brook
northward to the Solent, we come to continually more
recent beds overlying those which appear to the south
of them.</p>

<p>When, as in the south side of our central downs, the
strata are sharply cut away by denudation, we call this
an <i>escarpment</i>. The <a href="#Fig_1">figure</a> shows the structure of the
Sandown anticline we have described. We must now
examine the rocks more closely, beginning with the lowest
strata in the Island, and try to read the story they have
to tell.

<div class="chapt_hdr">Chapter III</div>

<div class="chapt_ttl">THE WEALDEN STRATA: THE LAND OF THE IGUANODON</div>

<p>The lowest strata in the Isle of Wight are the coloured
marls and blue-grey shales we have already observed in
Sandown Bay, which run through the Island to Brook
Bay. They are known as the Wealden Strata, because
the same strata cover the part of Kent and Sussex called
the Weald. They consist of marls and shales with bands
of sandstone and limestone. The marls and shales in
wet weather become very soft, and flow out on to the
shore, causing large slips of land.<a name="FNanchor_A_1" id="FNanchor_A_1"></a><a href="#Footnote_A_1" class="fnanchor">[1]</a> Now, what we want
to find out is what the world was like ages ago, when
these Wealden Strata were being formed. We have
learnt something of how clays and sandstones and limestones
are formed: to learn more we must see what sort
of fossils we can find in these rocks. "Fossil" means
something dug up; and the word is generally used for
remains of animals or plants which we find buried in the
rocks. We have seen shells in these strata. These we
must examine more closely. And as we walk on the shore
we shall find other fossils. In the marls and shales exposed
on the shore we are pretty sure to see pieces of wood,
black as coal, sometimes quite large logs, often partly
covered with shining iron pyrites. Perhaps you say&mdash;I
hope you do&mdash;there must have been land not far away
when these marls and shales were forming. Always try
to see what the things we find have to tell us. The sort
of place where we should be most likely to find wood
floating in the sea to-day would be near the mouth of a
great river like the Mississippi or the Amazon,&mdash;rivers
which bring down numerous logs of wood from the forest
country through which they flow.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">[Pg&nbsp;16]</a></span>
Examine the shales and limestone bands. On the
surface of some of the paper-shales are numbers of small
round or oval white spots. They are the remains of shells
of a very minute crustacean, Cypris and Cypridea, from
which the shales are known as Cyprid shales. In other
bands of shale are quantities of a bivalve shell called
<i>Cyrena</i>. There is a band of limestone made up of Cyrena
shells, containing also little roundish spiral shells called
<i>Paludina</i>.<a name="FNanchor_A_2" id="FNanchor_A_2"></a><a href="#Footnote_A_2" class="fnanchor">[2]</a> This limestone resembles that called Sussex
or Petworth Marble, which is mainly composed of shells
of Paludina, but some layers also contain bivalve shells.
It is hard enough to take a good polish, and may be seen,
like the similar Purbeck marble, in some of our grand old
churches. Another band of limestone running through
the shales is made up of small oysters (<i>Ostrea distorta</i>).</p>

<p>We shall see fossil shells best on the <i>weathered</i> surfaces
of rocks, <i>i.e.</i>, surfaces which have been exposed to the
weather. One beginning geological study will probably
think we shall find fossils best by looking at fresh broken
surfaces of rock. This is not so. If you want to find
fossils, look at the rock where it has been exposed to the
weather. The action of the weather&mdash;rain, carbonic
dioxide in the rain water, etc.&mdash;is to sculpture the surface
of the rock, so that the fossils stand out in relief. A
weathered surface is often seen covered with fossils, when
a new broken one shows none at all.</p>

<p>Many of the shells in the limestones are very like shells
which are found at the present day. We must know
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17">[Pg&nbsp;17]</a></span>
where they are found now. Well, these Paludinas are a
kind of freshwater snail; and, in fact, all the shells we
find in the Wealden strata are freshwater shells, till we
come near the top, and find the oysters, which live in
salt or brackish water. There were quantities in Brading
Harbour in old days, before it was reclaimed from the sea.
Now, this is a very important point, that our Wealden
shells are freshwater shells. For what does it tell us?
Why, we see that the first strata we have come to examine
were not laid down in the sea at all. Then where were
they formed? They seem to be the Delta of a great
river, long since passed away, like the Nile, the Amazon,
or the Niger at the present day. When these great rivers
near the sea, they spread out in many channels, and
deposit the mud they have brought down over a wide
area shaped like a V, or like the Greek letter <a name="Greek_D">&#916;</a>).
Hence we speak of the Delta of the Nile. Some river
deltas are of immense size. That of the Niger, for
instance, is 170 miles long, and the line where it meets
the sea is 300 miles long. Our old Wealden river must
have been a great river like the Niger, for the Wealden
strata stretch,&mdash;often covered up for a long way by later
rocks, then appearing again,&mdash;as far as Lulworth on the
Dorset coast to the west, into Buckinghamshire on the
north, while to the north east they not only cover the
Weald, but pass under the Straits of Dover into Belgium,
and very similar strata are found in Westphalia and
Hanover. The ancient river delta must have been 200
miles or more across.</p>

<p>You must not think this great river flowed in the
Island of England as it is to-day. England was being
made then. This must have been part of a great continent
in those days, for such a great river to flow through,
and form a delta of such size. We cannot tell quite what
was the course of this river. But to the north of where
we are now must have stretched a great continent, with
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">[Pg&nbsp;18]</a></span>
chains of lofty mountains far away, from which the head
waters of the river flowed. Near its mouth the river
broke up into many streams, separated by marsh land;
while inside the sand banks of the sea shore would be
large lagoons as in the Nile delta at the present day.
In these waters lived the shellfish whose shells we are
finding. And flowing through great forests the river carried
down with it logs of wood and whole trees, and left them
stuck in the mud near its mouths for us to find to-day.</p>

<p>What kind of trees grew in the country the river came
from? Well, there were no oaks or beeches, no flowering
chestnuts or apples or mays. But there were great
forests of coniferous trees; that is trees like our pines
and firs, cedars and yews, and araucarias; and there were
cycads&mdash;a very different kind of tree, but also bearing
cones&mdash;which you may see in a greenhouse in botanical
gardens. They have usually a short trunk, sometimes
nearly hemispherical, with leaves like the long leaves of a
date palm. They are sometimes called sago trees, for
the trunk has a large pith, which, like some palms, gives
us sago. Stems of cycads, covered with diamond-shaped
scars, where the leaf stalks have dropped off, are found
in the Wealden deposits. Most of the wood we find is
black and brittle. Some, however, is hard as stone, where
the actual substance of the wood has been replaced by
silica, preserving beautifully the structure of the wood.
Specially noteworthy are fragments of a tree called
<i>Endogenites</i> (or <i>Tempskya</i>) <i>erosa</i>, because it was at first
supposed to belong to the endogens,&mdash;the class to which
the palm bamboo belong; it is now considered to be
a tree-fern. Many specimens of this wood are remarkably
beautiful, when polished, or in their natural condition.
Here, by the way, it may be well to explain how
we name animals and plants scientifically. We have
English names only for the commoner varieties. So we
have to invent names for the greater number of living and
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19">[Pg&nbsp;19]</a></span>
extinct animals and plants. And the best way is found
to be this. We give a name, generally formed from the
Latin&mdash;or the Greek&mdash;to a group of animals or plants,
which closely resemble one another; the group we call
a <i>genus</i>. Then for the <i>species</i>, the particular kind of
animal or plant of the group, we add a second name to
the first. Thus, if we are studying the apple and pear
group of fruit trees, we call the general name of the group
<i>Pyrus</i>. Then the crab apple is <i>Pyrus malus</i>, the wild
pear <i>P. communis</i>, and so on. So that when you arrange
any of your species, and put down the scientific names,
you are really doing a bit of classification as well. You
are arranging your specimens with their nearest relations.</p>

<p>To return to our ancient river. With the logs and
trunks of trees, which the river brought down, came
floating down also the bodies of animals, which had lived
in the country the river flowed through. What kind of
animals? Very wonderful animals, some of them, not
like any living creature that lives to-day. By the time
they reached the mouth of the river the bodies had come
to pieces, and their bones were scattered about the river
mouth. On the shore where we are walking we may find
some of these bones. But it is rather a chance whether
we find any in any one walk we take. The best time to
find them is when rough seas in winter have washed some
out of the clay, and left them on the shore. It is only
rarely that large bones are found here; but you should
be able to find some small ones fairly often. The bones
are quite as heavy as stone, for all the pores and cavities
have been filled with stone, generally carbonate of lime,
in the way we explained in describing the formation of
beds of limestone. This makes them quite different from
any present-day bones that may happen to lie on the
shore. So that you cannot mistake them, if once you
have seen them. They are bones of great reptiles,&mdash;the
class of creatures to which lizards and crocodiles belong.
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">[Pg&nbsp;20]</a></span>
But these were much larger than crocodiles, and quite
peculiar in their appearance. The principal one was the
Iguanodon. He stood on his hind legs like a kangaroo,
with a great thick tail, which may have helped to support
him. When full grown he stood about 14&nbsp;ft. high. You
may find on the shore vertebr&aelig;, <i>i.e.</i>, joints of the backbone,
sometimes large, sometimes quite small if they come
from the end of the tail. I have found several here about
5 inches long by 4 or 5 across. A few years ago I found
the end of a leg bone almost a foot in diameter. Dr.
Mantell, a great geological explorer in the days when these
reptiles were first discovered about 80 years ago, estimated
from the size of part of a bone found in Sandown Bay
that one of these reptiles must have had a leg 9&nbsp;ft. long.
It was a long time after the bones of these creatures were
first found before it was known what they really looked
like. The animals lived a long way from here, and by
the time the river had washed them down to its mouth
the skeletons were broken up, and the bones scattered.
At last a discovery was made, which told us what the
animals were like. In a coal mine at Bernissart in
Belgium the miners found the coal seam they were following
suddenly come to an end, and they got into a mass
of clay. After a while it was seen what had happened.
They had struck the buried channel of an old river, which
in the Wealden days had flowed through and cut its
channel in the coal strata, which are much older still
than the Wealden. And in the mud of the ancient buried
river what should they come upon but whole skeletons
of Iguanodons. In the days of long ago the great beasts
had come down to the river to drink, and had got "bogged"
in the soft clay. The skeletons were carefully got out,
and set up in the Museum at Brussels. Without going
so far as that, you may see in the Natural History Museum
in London, or the Geological Museum at Oxford, a
facsimile of one of these skeletons, large as life, and have
some idea of the sort of beast the Iguanodon was. I
should tell you why he was so named. Before it was
known what he was like in general form, it was found that
his teeth, which are of a remarkable character, were
similar to those of the Iguana, a little lizard of the West
Indies. So he was called Iguanodon,&mdash;an animal with
teeth like the Iguana (fr. <i>Iguana</i>, and Gk. <a name="Greek_odous">&#972;&#948;&#959;&#973;&#962;</a> g. <a name="Greek_odontos">&#972;&#948;&#972;&#957;&#964;&#965;&#962;</a>
a tooth). He was quite a harmless beast, though he was
so large. He was a vegetarian. There were other great
reptiles, more or less like him, which were also vegetable
feeders. But there were also carnivorous reptiles,
generally smaller than the herbivorous, whose teeth tell
us that they preyed on other animals.</p>

Those were the days of reptiles. Now the earth is the
domain of the mammalia. But then great reptiles like
the Iguanodon wandered over the land; great marine
reptiles, such as the Plesiosaurus, swam the waters; and
wonderful flying reptiles, the Pterodactyls, flew the air.
Some species of these were quite small, the size of a rook:
one large species found in the Isle of Wight had a spread
of wing of 16 feet. Imagine this strange world,&mdash;its
forests with pines and monkey puzzles and cycads,&mdash;ferns
also, of which many fragments are found,&mdash;its great
reptiles and little reptiles, on land, in the water and the
air. Were there no birds? Yes, but they were rare.
From remains found in Oolitic strata,&mdash;somewhat older
than the Wealden,&mdash;we know that birds were already
in existence; and they were as strange as anything else.
For they had jaws with teeth like the reptiles. They had
not yet adopted the beak. And instead of all the tail
feathers starting from one point, as in birds of the present
day, these ancient birds had long curving tails like reptiles,
with a pair of feathers on each joint. Birds of similar but
slightly more modern type have been found in Cretaceous
strata (to which the Wealden belongs) in America, but so
far not in strata of this age in Britain.</p>

<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">[Pg&nbsp;22]</a></span>
<p>Among other objects of interest along this Wealden
shore may be noticed a curious transformation which has
affected the surface of some of the shell limestones after
they were formed, which is known as cone-in-cone structure.
It has quite altered the outer layer of the rock, so that all
trace of the shells of which it consists is obliterated. Numerous
pieces of iron ore from various strata lie on the shore.
Through most of English history the Weald of Kent and
Sussex was the great iron-working district of England.
The ore from the Wealden strata was smelted by the
help of charcoal made from the woods that grew there,
and gave the district its name;&mdash;for <i>Weald</i> means "forest."
This industry gradually ceased, as the much larger supplies
of iron ore found near the coal in the mines of the North
of England came to be worked. Iron pyrites, sulphide of
iron in crystalline form, was formerly collected on the
Sandown shore, and sent to London for the manufacture
of sulphuric acid. This mineral is often found encrusting
fossil wood. It also occurs as rounded nodules (mostly
derived from the Lower Chalk) with a brown outer coat,
and often showing a beautiful radiated metallic structure,
when broken. (This form is called marcasite.)</p>

<p>As we walk by the edge of the water, we shall see what
pretty stones lie along the beach. When wet with the
ripples many look like polished jewels. Some are agates,
bright purple and orange in colour, some clear translucent
chaldedony. We shall have more to say about these
later on. They do not come from the Wealden, but from
beds of flint gravel, and are washed along the shore. But
there are also jaspers from the Wealden. These are
opaque, generally red and yellow. There are also pieces
of variegated quartz, and other beautiful pebbles of
various mineral composition. These are stones from older
rocks, which have been washed down the Wealden rivers,
and buried in the Wealden strata, to be washed out again
after hundreds of thousands of years, and rolled about
on the shore on which we walk to-day.</p>

<div class="chapt_hdr">Chapter IV</div>

<div class="chapt_ttl">THE LOWER GREENSAND</div>


<p>For ages the Wealden river flowed, and over its vast delta
laid down its depth of river mud. The land was gradually
sinking; for continually strata of river mud were laid
down over the same area, all shallow-water strata, yet
counting hundreds of feet in thickness in all. At last a
change came. The land sank more rapidly, and in over
the delta the sea water flowed. The sign of coming change
is seen in the limestone band made up of small oysters
near the top of the Wealden strata. Marine life was
beginning to appear.</p>

<p>Above the Wealden shales in Sandown Bay may be
seen a band of brown rock. It is in places much covered by
slip, but big blocks lie about the shore, and it runs out to
sea as a reef before we come to the Red Cliff. The blocks
are seen to consist of a hard grey stone, but the weathered
surfaces are soft and brown. They are full of fossils, all
marine, sea shells and corals. The sea has washed in
well over our Wealden delta, and with this bed the next
formation, the Lower Greensand, begins. The bed is
called the Perna bed, from a large bivalve shell (<i>Perna
mulleti</i>) frequently to be found in it, though it is difficult
to obtain perfect specimens showing the long hinge of
the valve, which is a marked feature of the shell. Among
other shells are a large round bivalve <i>Corbis</i> (<i>Sph&aelig;ra</i>)
<i>corrugata</i>, a flatter bivalve <i>Astarte</i>,&mdash;and a smaller oblong
shell <i>Panop&aelig;a</i>,&mdash;also a peculiar shell of triangular form,
<i>Trigonia</i>,&mdash;one species <i>T. caudata</i> has raised ribs running
across it, another <i>T. d&aelig;dalea</i> has bands of raised spots.
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">[Pg&nbsp;24]</a></span>
A pretty little coral, looking like a collection of little stars,
<i>Holocystis elegans</i>, one of the Astr&aelig;id&aelig;, is often very
sharply weathered out.</p>

<p>Above the Perna bed lies a mass of blue clay, weathering
brown, called the Atherfield clay, because it appears
on a great scale at Atherfield on the south west of the
Island. It is very like the clay of the Wealden shales,
but is not divided into thin layers like shale.</p>

<p>Next we come to the fine mass of red sandstone which
forms the vertical wall of Red Cliff. Not many fossils
are to be found in these strata. Let us note the beauty
of colouring of the Red Cliff&mdash;pink and green, rich orange
and purple reds. And then let us pass to the other side
of the anticline, and walk on the shore to Shanklin. Here
we see the red sandstone rocks again, but now dipping
to the south. You probably wonder why these red cliffs
are called Greensand. But look at the rocks where they
run out as ledges on the shore towards Shanklin. Here
they are dark green. And this is really their natural
colour. They are made of a mixture of sand and clay
coloured dark green by a mineral called glauconite.
Grains of glauconite can easily be seen in a handful of
sand,&mdash;better with a magnifying glass. This mineral is
a compound of iron, with silica and potash, and at the
surface of the rock it is altered chemically, and oxide of
iron is formed&mdash;the same thing as rust. And that colours
all the face of the cliff red. The iron is also largely responsible
for our finding so few fossils in these strata.
By chemical changes, in which the iron takes part, the
material of the shells is destroyed.<a name="FNanchor_A_3" id="FNanchor_A_3"></a><a href="#Footnote_A_3" class="fnanchor">[3]</a> Near Little Stairs
hollows in the rock may be seen, where large oyster shells
have been. In some you may find a broken piece of shell,
but the shells have been mostly destroyed. Nearer
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25">[Pg&nbsp;25]</a></span>
Shanklin we shall find large oysters, <i>Exogyra sinuata</i>, in the
rock ledges exposed at low tide. Some are stuck together in
masses. Evidently there was an oyster bank here. And
here the shells have not been destroyed like those in the cliff.</p>

<p>
From black bands in the cliff water full of iron oozes
out, staining the cliff red and yellow and orange, and
trickling down, stains the flint stones lying on the shore
a bright orange. At the foot of the cliff you may sometimes
see what looks like a bed of conglomerate, <i>i.e.</i>, a
bed of rounded pebbles cemented together. This does
not belong to the cliff, but is made up of the flint pebbles
on the shore, and the sand in which they lie, cemented
into a solid mass by the iron in the water which has
flowed from the cliff. It is a modern conglomerate, and
shows us how old conglomerates were formed, which we
often find in the various strata. The cement, however,
in these is not always iron oxide. It may be siliceous or
of other material. The iron-charged water is called
chalybeate; springs at Shanklin and Niton at one time
had some fame for their strengthening powers. The
strata we have been examining are known as the Ferruginous
sands, <i>i.e.</i>, iron sands (Lat. <i>ferrum</i>, "iron").
Beyond Shanklin is a fine piece of cliff. Look up at it,
but beware of going too close under it. The upper part
consists of a fine yellow sand called the Sandrock. At
the base of this are two bands of dark clay. These bands
become filled with water, and flow out, causing the sandrock
which rests on them to break away in large masses,
and fall on to the beach.</p>

<p>It is clay bands such as these which are the cause of
our Undercliffs in the Isle of Wight. Turn the point,
and you see exactly how an undercliff is formed. You
see a wide platform at the level of the clay, which has
slipped out, and let down the sandrock which rested on it.
Beyond Luccombe Chine a large landslip took place in
1910, a great mass of cliff breaking away, and leaving a
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">[Pg&nbsp;26]</a></span>
ravine behind partly filled with fallen pine trees. The
whole fallen mass has since sunk lower and nearer to the
sea. The broken ground overgrown with trees called the
Landslip, as well as the whole extent of the ground from
Ventnor and Niton, has been formed in a similar way.
But the clay which by its slip has produced these is
another clay called the Gault, higher up in the strata.
At the top of the high cliff near Luccombe Chine a hard
gritty stratum of rock called the Carstone is seen above
the Sandrock, and above it lies the Gault clay, which
flows over the edge of the cliff.</p>

<p>In the rock ledges and fallen blocks of stone between
Shanklin and Luccombe many more fossils may be found
than in the lower part of the Ferruginous sands. Besides
bands of oysters, blocks of stone are to be found crowded
with a pretty little shell called <i>Rhynchonella</i>. There are
others with many <i>Terebratul&aelig;</i>, and others with fragments
of sea urchins. The Terebratul&aelig; and Rhynchonell&aelig;
belong to a curious group of shells, the Brachiopods, which
are placed in a class distinct from the Mollusca proper.
They were very common in the very ancient seas of the
Cambrian period,&mdash;the period of the most ancient fossils
yet found,&mdash;and some, the Lingul&aelig;, have lived on almost
unchanged to the present day. One of the two valves is
larger than the other, and near the smaller end you will
see a little round hole. Out of this hole, when the creature
was alive, came a sort of neck, which attached it to the
rock, like the barnacles. There is a very hard ferruginous
band, of which nodules may be found along the shore,
full of beautifully perfect impressions of fossils, though
the fossils themselves are gone. Casts of a little round
bivalve shell, <i>Thetironia minor</i>, may easily be got out.
The nodules also contain casts of Trigonia, Panop&#339;a, etc.
A stratum is sometimes exposed on the shore containing
fossils converted into pyrites. A long shell, <i>Gervillia
sublanceolata</i>, is the most frequent.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27">[Pg&nbsp;27]</a></span>
All the shells we have found are of sea creatures, and
show us that the Greensand was a marine formation.
But the strata were formed in shallow water not far from
the shore. We have learnt that coarse sediment like sand
is not carried by the sea far from the coast. And a good
deal of the Greensand is coarser than sand. There are
numerous bands of small pebbles. The pebbles are of
various kinds; some are clear transparent quartz, bits of
rock-crystal more or less rounded by rolling on the shore
of the Greensand period. These go by the name of Isle
of Wight diamonds, and are very pretty when polished.
Another mark of the nearness of the shore when these
beds were laid down is the current bedding, of which a
good example may be seen in the cliff at the north of
Shanklin parade. It is sometimes called false bedding,
for the sloping bands do not mark strata laid down
horizontally at the bottom of the sea, but a current has
laid down layers in a sloping way,&mdash;it may be just over
the edge of a sandbank. Again notice how much wood is
to be seen in the strata. Land was evidently not far off.
All along the shore you may find hard pieces of mineralised
wood, the rings of growth often showing clearly. Frequently
marine worms have bored into them before they
were locked up in the strata; the holes being generally
filled afterwards with stone or pyrites.</p>

<p>The wood is mostly portions of trunks or branches of
coniferous trees. We also find stems of cycads. There
has been found at Luccombe a very remarkable fruit of
a kind of cycad. We said that in the Wealden period
none of our flowering plants grew. But these specimens
found at Luccombe show that cycads at that time were
developing into flowering plants. Wonderful specimens
of what may almost be called cycad flowers have been
found in strata of about this age in Wyoming in America;
and this Luccombe cycad,&mdash;called Benettites Gibsonianus,&mdash;shows
what these were like in fruit. Remains of
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28">[Pg&nbsp;28]</a></span>
various cycadeous plants have been found in the corresponding
strata at Atherfield; and possibly by further
research fresh knowledge may be gained of an intensely
interesting story,&mdash;the history of the development of
flowering plants.</p>

<p>On the whole the vegetation of the period was much
the same as in the Wealden. But these flowering cycads
must have formed a marked addition to the landscape,&mdash;if
indeed they did not already exist in the Wealden times.
The cones of present day cycads are very splendidly
coloured,&mdash;orange and crimson,&mdash;and it can hardly be
doubted that the cycad flowers were of brilliant hues.</p>

<p>The land animals were still like the Wealden reptiles.
Bones of large reptiles may at times be found on the
shore at Shanklin. Several have been picked up recently.
From the prevalence of cycads we may conclude that the
climate of the Wealden and Lower Greensand was sub-tropical.
The existing Cycadace&aelig; are plants of South
Eastern Asia, and Australia, the Cape, and Central
America. The forest of trees allied to pines and firs and
cedars probably occupied the higher land. Turtles and
the corals point to warm waters. The existing species of
Trigonia are Australian shells. This beautiful shell is
found plentifully in Sydney harbour. It possesses a
peculiar interest, as the genus was supposed to be extinct,
and was originally described from the fossil forms, and
was afterwards found to be still living in Australia.</p>

<div class="chapt_ttl">BROOK AND ATHERFIELD</div>


<p>To most Sandown Bay is by far the most accessible place
in the Island to study the earlier strata; and for our
first geological studies it has the advantage of showing a
succession of strata so tilted that we can pass over one
formation after another in the course of a short walk.
But when we have learnt the nature of geological research,
and how to read the record of the rocks, and examined
the Wealden and Greensand strata in Sandown Bay, we
shall do well, if possible, to make expeditions to Brook
and Atherfield, to see the splendid succession of Wealden
and Greensand strata shown in the cliffs of the south-west
of the Island. It is a lonely stretch of coast, wild and
storm-swept in winter. But this part of the Island is
full of interest and charm to the lover of Nature and of
the old-world villages and the old churches and manor
houses which fit so well into their natural surroundings.
The villages in general lie back under the shelter of the
downs some distance from the shore; a coastguard station,
a lonely farm house, or some fishermen's houses as at
Brook, forming the only habitations of man we come to
along many miles of shore. Brook Point is a spot of great
interest to the geologist. Here we come upon Wealden
strata somewhat older than any in Sandown Bay. The
shore at the Point at low tide is seen to be strewn with
the trunks of fossil trees. They are of good size, some
20&nbsp;ft. in length, and from one to three feet in diameter.
They are known as the Pine Raft, and evidently form a
mass of timber floated down an ancient river, and stranded
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30">[Pg&nbsp;30]</a></span>
near the mouth, just as happens with great accumulations
of timber which float down the Mississippi at the present
day. The greater part of the wood has been replaced
by stone, the bark remaining as a carbonaceous substance
like coal, which, however, is quickly destroyed when
exposed to the action of the waves. The fossil trees are
mostly covered with seaweed. On the trunks may sometimes
be found black shining scales of a fossil fish,
<i>Lepidotus Mantelli</i>. (A stratum full of the scales of
<i>Lepidotus</i> has been recently exposed in the Wealden of
Sandown Bay.) The strata with the Pine Raft form the
lowest visible part of the anticline. From Brook Point
the Wealden strata dip in each direction, east and west.
As the coast does not cut nearly so straight across the
strata as in Sandown Bay, we see a much longer section
of the beds. On either side of the Point are coloured
marls, followed by blue shales, as at Sandown. To the
westward, however, after the shales we suddenly come to
variegated marls again, followed by a second set of shales.
There was long a question whether this repetition is due
to a fault, or whether local conditions have caused a
variation in the type of the beds. The conclusion of the
Geological Survey Memoir, 1889, rather favoured the
latter view, on the ground of the great change which has
taken place in the character of the beds in so short a
distance, assuming them to be the same strata repeated.
The conjecture of the existence of a fault has, however,
been confirmed; for during the last years a most interesting
section has been visible at the junction of the shales
and marls, where a fault was suspected. The shales in
the cliff and on the shore are contorted into the form of a
<span class="bold bigger">Z</span>. The section appears to have become visible about
1904 (it was in the spring of that year that I first saw it),
and was described by Mr. R. W. Hooley, F.G.S. (<i>Proc.
Geol. Ass.</i>, vol. xix., 1906, pp. 264, 265). It has remained
visible since.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_31" id="Page_31">[Pg&nbsp;31]</a></span>
The Wealden of Brook and the neighbouring coast is
celebrated for the number of bones of great reptiles found
here, from the early days of geological research, the '20's
and '30's of last century, when admirable early geologists,
such as Dr. Buckland and Dr. Mantell, were discovering
the wonders of that ancient world, to the present time.
Various reptiles have been found besides the Iguanodon&mdash;the
Megalosaurus, a great reptile somewhat similar, but
of lighter build, with sabre-shaped teeth, with serrated
edges: the Hyl&aelig;osaurus, a smaller creature with an
armour of plates on the back, and a row of angular spines
along the middle of the back; the huge <i>Hoplosaurus
hulkei</i>, probably 70 or 80 feet in length; the marine
Plesiosaurus and Ichthyosaurus, and several more; also
bones of a freshwater turtle and four types of crocodiles.
In various beds a large freshwater shell, <i>Unio valdensis</i>,
occurs, and in the cliffs of Brook have been found many
cones of Cycadean plants. In bands of white sandy clay
are fragments of ferns, <i>Lonchopteris Mantelli</i>. In the
shales are bands of limestone with Cyrena, Paludina, and
small oysters, and paper shales with cyprids, as at Sandown.
The shore near Atherfield Point is covered with
fallen blocks of the limestones.</p>

<p>The Lower Greensand is seen in Compton Bay on the
northern side of the Brook anticline. Here is a great
slip of Atherfield clay. The beds above the clay are
much thinner than at Atherfield, and fossils are comparatively
scarce. On the south of the anticline the
Perna bed slopes down to the sea about 150 yards east of
Atherfield Point, and runs out to sea as a reef. Large
blocks lie on the shore, where numerous fossils may be
found on the weathered surfaces. The ledges which here
run out to sea form a dangerous reef, on which many
vessels have struck. There is now a bell buoy on the reef.
On the headland is a coastguard station, and till lately
there has been a sloping wooden way from the top of the
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32">[Pg&nbsp;32]</a></span>
cliff to bring the lifeboat down. This was washed away
in the storms of the winter 1912-13.</p>

<p>Above the Perna bed lies a great thickness of Atherfield
clay. Above this lies what is called the Lower Lobster
bed, a brown clay and sand, in which are numerous nodules
containing the small lobster <i>Meyeria vectensis</i>,&mdash;known as
Atherfield lobsters. Many beautiful specimens have been
obtained.</p>

<p>We next come to a great thickness of the Ferruginous
Sands, some 500 feet. The Lower Greensand of Atherfield
was exhaustively studied in the earlier days of geology
by Dr. Fitton, in the years 1824-47, and the different
strata are still referred to according to his divisions. The
lowest bed is the Crackers group about 60&nbsp;ft. thick. In
the lower part are two layers of hard calcareous boulder-shaped
concretions, some a few feet long. The lower
abound in fossils, and though hard when falling from the
cliffs are broken up by winter frosts, showing the fossils
they contain beautifully preserved in the softer sandy
cores of the concretions. <i>Gervillia sublanceolata</i> is very
frequent, also <i>Thetironia minor</i>, the Ammonite <i>Hoplites
deshayesi</i>, and many more. Beneath and between the
nodular masses caverns are formed, the resounding of the
waves in which has given the name of the "Crackers."
In the upper part of this group is a second lobster bed.</p>

<p>The most remarkable fossils in the Lower Greensand
are the various genera and species of the ammonites and
their kindred. The Ammonite, through many formations,
was one of the largest, and often most beautiful shells.
There were also quite small species. The number of
species was very great. Now the whole group is extinct.
They most resembled the Pearly Nautilus, which still lives.
In both the shell is spiral, and consists of several chambers,
the animal living in the outer chamber, the rest being
air-chambers enabling it to float. The class Cephalopoda,
which includes the Ammonites, the Nautilus, and also the
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_33" id="Page_33">[Pg&nbsp;33]</a></span>
Cuttle-fish, is the highest division of the Mollusca. The
animals all possess heads with eyes, and tentacles around
the mouth. They nearly all possess a shell, either external,
as in the Nautilus, or internal, as in the cuttle-fishes, the
internal shell of which is often washed ashore after a
rough sea. The Cephalopods are divided into two orders.
The first includes the Cuttle-fish and the Argonaut or
Paper Nautilus. Their tentacles are armed with suckers,
and they have highly-developed eyes. They secrete an
inky fluid, which forms sepia. The internal shell of
extinct species of cuttle-fish, of a cylindrical shape, with
a pointed end, is a common fossil in various strata, and
is known as a Belemnite (Gr. <a name="Greek_belemnon">&#946;&#949;&#955;&#949;&#956;&#969;&#957;</a> "a dart".)
The second order includes the Pearly Nautilus of the present
day, and the numerous extinct Nautiloids and Ammonoids.
The tentacles of the Pearly Nautilus have no suckers;
and the eyes are of a curiously primitive structure,&mdash;what
may be called a pin-hole camera, with no lens. The
shells of the Nautilus and its allies are of simpler form,
while the Ammonites are characterised by the complicated
margins of the partition walls or septa, by which the
shells are sub-divided. The chambers of the fossil
Ammonites have often been filled with crystals of rich
colours; and a polished section showing the chambers
is then a most beautiful object.<a name="FNanchor_A_4" id="FNanchor_A_4"></a><a href="#Footnote_A_4" class="fnanchor">[4]</a></p>

<p>Continuing along the shore, we come to the Lower
Exogyra group, where <a href="#Terebratula"><i>Terebratula sella</i></a> is found in great
abundance. A reef with <i>Exogyra sinuata</i> runs out about
350 yards west of Whale Chine. The group is 33&nbsp;ft. thick,
and is followed by the Scaphites group, 50&nbsp;ft. The beds
contain <i>Exogyra sinuata</i>, and a reef with clusters of
Serpul&aelig; runs out from the cliff. In the middle of the
group are bands of nodules containing <i>Macroscaphites
gigas</i>. The Lower Crioceras bed (16&nbsp;ft.) follows, and
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_34" id="Page_34">[Pg&nbsp;34]</a></span>
crosses the bottom of Whale Chine. The Scaphites and
Crioceras are Cephalopoda, related to the Ammonites;
but in this Lower Cretaceous period a remarkable development
took place; many of the shells began to take
curious forms, to unwind as it were. Crioceras, a very
beautiful shell, has the form of an Ammonite, but the
whorls are not in contact; thus making an open spiral
like a ram's horn, whence its name (Gk. <a name="Greek_keras">&#954;&#941;&#961;&#959;&#962;</a>, ram,
<a name="Greek_krios">&#954;&#961;&#953;&#972;&#962;</a>, horn). Ancyloceras begins like Crioceras, but from
the last whorl continues for some length in a straight course,
then bends back again; Macroscaphites is similar, but the
whorls of the spiral part are in contact. In Scaphites, a
much smaller shell, the uncoiled part is much shorter,
and its outline more rounded. It is named from its
resemblance to a boat (Gk. <a name="Greek_skaphe">&#963;&#954;&#940;&#966;&#951;</a>).<a name="FNanchor_A_5" id="FNanchor_A_5"></a><a href="#Footnote_A_5" class="fnanchor">[5]</a></p>

<p>The Walpen and Ladder Clays and Sands (about 60&nbsp;ft.)
contain nodules with Exogyra and the Ammonite
<i>Douvilleiceras martini</i>. The dark-green clays of the lower
part form an undercliff, on to which Ladder Chine opens.
The Upper Crioceras Group (46&nbsp;ft.), like the Lower, contains
bands of Crioceras? also <i>Douvilleiceras martini</i>,
Gervillia, Trigonia, etc. It must be stated that there
is some uncertainty with regard to the ammonoids found
in this neighbourhood, Macroscaphites having been
described as Ancyloceras, and also sometimes as Crioceras.
The discovery of the true Ancyloceras (<i>Ancyloceras
Matheronianum</i>) at Atherfield is described (and a figure
given) by Dr. Mantell; but what is the characteristic
ammonoid of the "Crioceras" beds requires further
investigation. The neighbourhood of Whale and Walpen
Chines is of great interest. Ammonites may be found in
the bottom of Whale Chine fallen out of the rock. Red
ferruginous nodules with Ammonites lie on the shore,
in the Chines, and on the Undercliff, some of the ammonites
more or less converted into crystalline spar.
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_35" id="Page_35">[Pg&nbsp;35]</a></span>
Hard ledges of the Crioceras beds run into the sea. The
shore is usually covered deep with sand and small shingle;
but there are times when the sea has washed the ledges
clear; and it is then that the shore should be examined.</p>

<p>The Walpen and Ladder Sands (42&nbsp;ft.); the Upper
Exogyra Group (16&nbsp;ft.); the Cliff End Sand (28&nbsp;ft.); and
the Foliated Clay and Sand (25&nbsp;ft.), consisting of thin
alternations of greenish sand and dark-blue clay, follow.
Then the Sands of Walpen Undercliff (about 100&nbsp;ft.);
over which lie the Ferruginous Bands of Blackgang Chine
(20&nbsp;ft.). Over these hard beds the cascade of the Chine
falls. Cycads and other vegetable remains are found in
this neighbourhood. Throughout the Atherfield Greensand
fragments of the fern <i>Lonchopteris</i> (<i>Weichselia</i>)
<i>Mantelli</i> are found. 220&nbsp;ft. of dark clays and soft white
or yellow sandrock complete the Lower Greensand. In
the upper beds of the Greensand few organic remains
occur. A beautiful section of Sandrock with the junction
of the Carstone is to be seen inland at Rock above Bright-stone.
The Sandrock here is brightly coloured like the
sands of Alum Bay,&mdash;though it belongs to a much older
formation,&mdash;and shows current bedding very beautifully.
The junction of the Sandrock and Carstone is also well
seen in the sandpit at Marvel.</p>

<p>We have now come to the end of the Lower Cretaceous,
in which are included the Wealden and the Lower Greensand.
Judged by the character of the flora and fauna,
the two form one period, the main difference being the
effect of the recession of the shore line, due to the subsidence
which let in the sea over the Wealden delta, so
that we have marine strata in place of freshwater deposits.
But that the plants and animals of the Wealden age still
lived in the not distant continent is shown by the remains
borne down from the land. These strata are an example
of a phenomenon often met with in geology,&mdash;that of a
great thickness of deposits all laid down in shallow water.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_36" id="Page_36">[Pg&nbsp;36]</a></span>
The Wealden of the Isle of Wight are some 700 feet thick,
in Kent a good deal thicker, the Hastings Sands, the
lower part of the formation, being below the horizon
occurring in the Island: the Lower Greensand is some
800 feet thick. In the ancient rocks of Wales, the
Cambrian and Silurian strata, are thousands of feet of
deposits, mostly laid down in fairly shallow water. In
such cases there has been a long-continued deposition of
sediment, while a subsidence of the area in which it was
laid down has almost exactly kept pace with the deposit.
It is difficult not to conclude that the subsidence has been
caused by the weight of the accumulating deposit,&mdash;continuing
until some world-movement of the contracting
globe has produced a compensating elevation of the area.</p>

<div class="chapt_hdr">Chapter VI</div>

<div class="chapt_ttl">THE GAULT AND UPPER GREENSAND</div>


<p>We have seen how the continent through which the great
Wealden river flowed began to sink below the sea level,
and how the waters of the sea flowed over what had been
the delta of the river, laying down the beds of sandstone
with some mixture of clay which we call the Lower
Greensand. The next stratum we come to is a bed of
dark blue clay more or less sandy, called the Gault. In
the upper beds it becomes more sandy and grey in colour.
These are known as the "passage beds," passing into the
Upper Greensand. The thickness of the Gault clay
proper varies from some 95 to 103 feet. Compared to the
mainland the Gault is of small thickness in the Island,
though the dark clay bands in the Sandrock mark the
oncoming of similar conditions. The fine sediment
forming the clay points to a further sinking of the sea
bed. In general, we find very few fossils in the Gault
in the Island, though it is very fossiliferous on the
mainland at Folkestone. North of Sandown Red Cliff
the Gault forms a gully, down which a footpath leads
to the shore. It is seen at the west of the Island in
Compton Bay, where in the lower part some fossil shells
may be found.</p>

<p>The Upper Greensand is not very well named, as the
beds only partially consist of sandstone, in great part of
quite other materials. Some prefer to call the Lower
Greensand Vectian, from Vectis, the old name of the Isle
of Wight, and the Upper Greensand Selbornian, a name
generally adopted, because it forms a marked feature of
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_38" id="Page_38">[Pg&nbsp;38]</a></span>
the country about Selborne in Hampshire.<a name="FNanchor_A_6" id="FNanchor_A_6"></a><a href="#Footnote_A_6" class="fnanchor">[6]</a> But,
though the Upper Greensand covers a less area in the
Isle of Wight than the Lower, it forms some of the most
characteristic scenery of the Island. One of the most
striking features of the Island is the Undercliff, the
undulating wooded country from Bonchurch to Niton,
above the sea cliff, but under a second cliff, a vertical
wall which shelters it to the North. This wall of cliff
consists of Upper Greensand. In a similar way to the
small undercliffs we saw at Luccombe, the Undercliff has
been formed by a series of great slips, caused here by the
flowing out of the Gault clay, which runs in a nearly
horizontal band through the base of all the Southern
Downs of the Island, the Upper Greensand lying above
it breaking off in masses, and leaving vertical walls of
cliff. These walls are seen not only in the Undercliff, but
also on the northern side of the downs, where they form
the inland cliff overhanging a pretty belt of woodland
from Shanklin to Cook's Castle, and again forming Gat
Cliff above Appuldurcombe. We have records of great
landslips at the two ends of the Undercliff, near Bonchurch
and at Rocken End, about a century ago. But
the greater part of the Undercliff was formed by landslips
in very ancient times, before recorded history in this
Island began. The outcrop of the Gault is marked by a
line of springs on all sides of the Southern Downs. The
strata above, Chalk and Upper Greensand, are porous
and absorb the rainfall, which permeates through till it
reaches the Gault Clay, which throws it out of the hill
side in springs, some of which furnish a water supply for
the surrounding towns and villages.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_39" id="Page_39">[Pg&nbsp;39]</a></span>
Where the Upper Greensand is best developed, above
the Undercliff, the passage beds are followed by 30 feet
of yellow micaceous sands, with layers of nodules of a
bluish-grey siliceous limestone known as Rag. The
nodules frequently contain large Ammonites and other
fossils. Next follow the Sandstone and Rag beds, about
50 feet of sandstone with alternating layers of rag. The
sandstones are grey in colour, weathering buff or reddish-brown,
tinged more or less green by grains of glauconite.
Near the top of these strata is the Freestone bed, a thick
bed of a close-grained sandstone, weathering a yellowish
grey, which forms a good building stone. Most of the
churches and old manor and farm houses in the southern
half of the Island are built of this stone. Then forming
the top of the series are 24 feet of chert beds,&mdash;bands of
a hard flinty rock called chert alternating with siliceous
sandstone, the sandstone containing large concretions of
rag in the same line of bedding. The chert beds are very
hard, and where the strata are horizontal, as above the
Undercliff, project like a cornice at the top of the cliff.
Perhaps the finest piece of the Upper Greensand is Gore
Cliff above Niton lighthouse, a great vertical wall with
the cornice of dark chert strata overhanging at the top.
The thickness in the Undercliff, including the Passage
Beds, is from 130 to 160&nbsp;ft.</p>

<p>The Upper Greensand may be studied at Compton Bay,
and at the Culvers; and along the shore west of Ventnor
the lower cliff by the sea consists largely of masses of
fallen Upper Greensand, many of which show the chert
strata well. In numerous walls in the south of the Island
may be seen stone from the various strata&mdash;sandstone,
blue limestone or rag, and also the chert.</p>

<p>Let us think what was happening when these beds were
being formed. The sandstone is much finer than that
of the Lower Greensand; and we have limestones now,&mdash;marine,
not freshwater as in the Wealden. Marine limestones
are formed by remains of sea creatures living at
some depth in clear water. And now we come to a new
material, chert. It is not unlike flint, and flint is one of
the mineral forms of silica. Chert may be called an
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_40" id="Page_40">[Pg&nbsp;40]</a></span>
impure or sandy flint. The bands of chert appear to have
been formed by an infiltration of silica into a sandstone,
forming a dense flinty rock, which, however, has a dull
appearance from the admixture of sand, instead of being
a black semi-transparent substance like flint. But where
did the silica come from? In the depths of the sea many
sea creatures have skeletons and shells formed of silica
or flint, instead of carbonate of lime, which is the material
of ordinary shells and of corals. Many sponges, instead
of the horny skeleton we use in the washing sponge, have
a skeleton formed of a network of needles of silica, often
of beautiful forms. Some marine animalcules, the
Radiolaria, have skeletons of silica. And minute plants,
the Diatoms, have coverings of silica, which remain like
a little transparent box, when the tiny plant is dead.
Now, much of the chert is full of needles, or spicules, as
they are called, of sponges, and this points to the source
from which some at least of the silica was derived. To
form the chert much of the silica has been in some manner
dissolved, and deposited again in the interstices of sandstone
strata. We shall have more to say of this process
when we come to speak of the origin of the flints in the
chalk. Sponges usually live in clear water of some depth;
so all shows that the sea was becoming deeper when these
strata were being formed.</p>

<p>Along the shore of the Undercliff, Upper Greensand
fossils may be found nicely weathered out. Very common
is a small curved bivalve shell,&mdash;a kind of small oyster,&mdash;<i>Exogyra
conica</i>, as are also serpul&aelig;, the tubes formed by
certain marine worms. Very pretty pectens (scallop
shells) are found in the sandstone. Many other shells,
<i>Terebratul&aelig;</i>, <i>Trigonia</i>, <i>Panop&aelig;a</i>, etc., occur, and several
species of ammonite and nautilus.<a name="FNanchor_A_7" id="FNanchor_A_7"></a><a href="#Footnote_A_7" class="fnanchor">[7]</a> A frequent fossil is
a kind of sponge, Siphonia. It has the form of an oblong
bulb, supported by a long stem, with a root-like base.
It is often silicified, and when broken shows bundles of
tubular channels.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_41" id="Page_41">[Pg&nbsp;41]</a></span>
In the chert may often be seen pieces of white or bluish
chalcedony, generally in thin plates filling cracks in the
chert. This is a very pure and hard form of silica,
beautifully clear and translucent. Pebbles which the
waves have worn in the direction of the plate are very
pretty when polished, and go by the name of sand agates.
They may sometimes be picked up on the shore near the
Culvers.</p>

<div class="chapt_hdr">Chapter VII</div>

<div class="chapt_ttl">THE CHALK</div>

<p>As we have traced the world's history written in the
rocks we have seen an old continent gradually submerged,
a deepening sea flowing over this part of the earth's
surface. Now we shall find evidence of the deepening of
the sea to something like an ocean depth. We are coming
to the great period of the Chalk, the time when the material
was made which forms the undulating downs of the south east
of England, and of which the line of white cliffs
consists, which with sundry breaks half encircles our
shores, from Flamborough Head in Yorkshire, by Dover
and the Isle of Wight, to Bere in Devon. Across the
Channel white cliffs of chalk face those of England, and
the chalk stretches inland into the Continent. Its extent
was formerly greater still. Fragments of chalk and flint
are preserved in Mull under basalt, an old lava flow, and
flints from the chalk are found in more recent deposits
(Boulder Clay) on the East of Scotland, pointing to a
former great extension northward, which has been nearly
all removed by denudation. In the Isle of Wight the
chalk cliffs of Freshwater and the Culvers are the grandest
features of the Island; while all the Island is dominated
by the long lines of chalk downs running through it from
east to west. Now what is the chalk? And how was it
made? The microscope must tell us. It is found that
this great mass of chalk is made up principally of tiny
microscopic shells called Foraminifera, whole and in crushed
fragments. There are plenty of foraminifera in the seas
to-day; and we need not go far to find similar shells.
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_43" id="Page_43">[Pg&nbsp;43]</a></span>
On the shore near Shanklin you will often see streaks of
what look like tiny bits of broken shell washed into
depressions in the sand. These, however, often consist
almost entirely of complete microscopic shells, some of
them of great beauty. The creature that lives in one
of these shells is only like a drop of formless jelly, and yet
around itself it forms a complex shell of surprising beauty.
The shells are pierced with a number of holes, hence their
name (fr. Lat. <i>foramen</i>, a hole, and <i>ferre</i>, to bear).
Through these holes the animal puts out a number of
feelers like threads of jelly, and in these entangles particles
of food, and draws them into itself. Now, do we anywhere
to-day find these tiny shells in such masses as to build
up rocks? We do. The sounding apparatus, with which
we measure the depths of the sea, is so constructed as to
bring up a specimen of the sea bottom. This has been
used in the Atlantic, and it is found that the really deep
sea bottom, too far out for rivers and currents to bring
sand and mud from the land, is covered with a white mud
or ooze. And the microscope shows this to be made up
of an unnumerable multitude of the tiny shells of foraminifera.
As the little creatures die in the sea, their shells
accumulate on the bottom, and in time will be pressed
into a hard mass like chalk, the whole being cemented
together by carbonate of lime, in the way we explained
in describing the making of limestones. So we find chalk
still forming at the present day. But what ages it must
take to form strata of solid rock of such tiny shells! And
what a vast period of time it must have required to build
up our chalk cliffs and downs, composed in large part of
tiny microscopic shells! With the foraminifera the
microscope shows in the chalk a multitude of crushed
fragments, largely the prisms which compose bivalve
shells, flakes of shells of Terebratula and Rhynchonella,
and minute fragments of corals and Bryozoa. Scattered
in the chalk we shall also find larger shells and other
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_44" id="Page_44">[Pg&nbsp;44]</a></span>
remains of the life of the ancient sea. The base of the
cliffs and fallen blocks on the shore are the best places to
find fossils. Much of the base of the cliffs is inaccessible
except by boat. The lower strata may be examined in
Sandown and Compton Bays, and the upper in Whitecliff
Bay. A watch should always be kept on the tide.
The quarries along the downs are not as a rule good for
collecting, as the chalk does not become so much sculptured
by weathering.</p>

<p>The deep sea of the White Chalk did not come suddenly.
In the oncoming of the period we find much marl&mdash;limy
clay. As the sea deepened, little reached the bottom but
the shells of foraminifera and other marine organisms.
How deep the sea became is uncertain: there is reason to
believe that it did not reach a depth such as that of the
Atlantic.</p>

<p>It is difficult to draw the line between the Upper
Greensand and the Chalk strata. Above the Chert beds
is a band a few feet thick known as the Chloritic Marl,
which shows a passage from sand to calcareous matter.
It is named from the abundance of grains of green colouring
matter, now recognised as glauconite; so that it
would be better called Glauconitic Marl. It is also remarkable
for the phosphatic nodules, and for the numerous
casts of Ammonites, Turrilites, and other fossils mostly
phosphatized, which it contains. This band is one of
the richest strata in the Island for fossils. It differs,
however, in different localities both in thickness and
composition. It is best seen above the Undercliff, and
in fallen masses along the shore from Ventnor to Niton.
It is finely exposed on the top of Gore Cliff, where the flat
ledges are covered with fossil Ammonites, Turrilites,
Pleurotomaria, and other shells. The Ammonite (<i>Schloenbachia
varians</i>) is especially common. The sponge
(<i>Stauronema carteri</i>) is characteristic of the Glauconitic
Marl. As the edge of the cliff is a vertical wall, none
should try this locality but those who can be trusted to
take proper care on the top of a precipice. When a high
wind is blowing the position may be especially dangerous.</p>

The Chloritic Marl is followed by the Chalk Marl, of
much greater thickness. This consists of alternations of
chalk with bands of Marl, and contains glauconite and
also phosphatic nodules in the lower part. Upwards it
merges into the Grey Chalk, a more massive rock, coloured
grey from admixture of clayey matter. These form the
Lower Chalk, the first of the three divisions into which
the Chalk is usually divided. Above this come the Middle
and Upper, which together form the White Chalk. They
are much purer white than the lower division, which is
creamy or grey in colour. The Chalk Marl and Grey
Chalk are well seen at the Culver Cliff, and run out in
ledges on the shore. The lower part of this division is the
most fossiliferous, and contains various species of Ammonities,
Turrilites, Nautilus, and other Cephalopoda.
(Of Ammonites <i>Schloenbachia varians</i> is characteristic.
Also may be named <i>S. Coupei</i>, <i>Mantelliceras mantelli</i>,
<i>Metacanthoplites rotomagensis</i>, <i>Calycoceras naviculare</i>,
the small Ammonoid Scaphites &aelig;qualis; and of Pectens,
<i>&AElig;quipecten beaveri</i> and <i>Syncyclonema orbicularis</i> may be
mentioned). White meandering lines of the sponge
<i>Plocoscyphia labrosa</i> are conspicuous in the lower beds.
The Chalk Marl is well shown at Gore Cliff, sloping upwards
from the flat ledges of the Chloritic Marl. It may be
studied well, and fossils found, in the cliff on the Ventnor
side of Bonchurch Cove,&mdash;which has all slipped down
from a higher level.</p>

<p>The uppermost strata of the Lower Chalk are known
as the Belemnite Marls. They are dark marly bands, in
which a Belemnite, <i>Actinocamax plenus</i>, is found. The
hard bands known as Melbourn Rock and Chalk Rock,
which on the mainland mark the top of the Lower and
Middle Chalk respectively, are neither of them well marked
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_46" id="Page_46">[Pg&nbsp;46]</a></span>
in the Isle of Wight. In the Middle Chalk <i>Inoceramus
labiatus</i>, a large bivalve shell, occurs in great profusion;
and in the Upper flinty Chalk are sheets of another species,
<i>I. Cuvieri</i>. It is hardly ever found perfect, the shells
being of a fibrous structure, with the fibres at right angles
to the surface, and so very fragile.</p>

<p>There is a striking difference between the Middle and
Upper Chalk, which all will observe. It consists in the
numerous bands of dark flints which run through the
Upper Chalk parallel to the strata. The Lower Chalk is
entirely, and the Middle Chalk nearly, devoid of flint.
Though the line at which the commencement of the Upper
Chalk is taken is rather below the first flint band of the
Upper Chalk, and a few flints occur in the highest beds
of the Middle Chalk; yet, speaking generally, the great
distinction between the Middle and Upper Chalk, the
two divisions of the White Chalk, may be considered to
be that of flintless chalk and chalk with flints.</p>

<p>Early in our studies we noticed the great curves into
which the upheaved strata have been thrown, and that
on the northern side of the anticline the strata are in
places vertical. This can be well observed in the Culver
Cliffs and Brading Down, where the strata of the Upper
Chalk are marked by the lines of black flints. In the
large quarry on Brading Down the vertical lines of flint
can be clearly seen; and by walking at low tide at Whitecliff
Bay round the corner of the cliff, or by observing the
cliff from a boat, we may see a beautiful section of the
flinty chalk, the lines of black flints sloping at a high
angle. The flints in general form round or oval masses,
but of irregular shape with many projections, and the
masses lie in regular bands parallel to the stratification.
The tremendous earth movement which has bent the
strata into a great curve has compressed the vertical
portion into about half its original thickness, and has
made the chalk of our downs extremely hard. It has
also shattered the flints in the chalk into fragments. The
rounded masses retain their form, but when pulled out of
the chalk fall into sharp angular fragments, and we find
they are shattered through and through.</p>

Now, what are flints, and how were they formed?
Flints are a form of silica, a purer form than chert, as the
chalk in which they are embedded was formed in the deep
sea, and so we have no admixture of sand. Flints, as we
find them in the chalk, are generally black translucent
nodules, with a white coating, the result of a chemical
action which has affected the outside after they were
formed. Flint is very hard,&mdash;harder than steel. You
cannot scratch it with a knife, though you may leave a
streak of steel on the surface of the flint. This hardness
is a property of other forms of silica, as quartz and chalcedony.
The question how the flints were formed is a
difficult one. As to this much still remains obscure.
The sea contains mineral substances in solution. Calcium
sulphate and chloride, and a small amount of calcium
carbonate (carbonate of lime) are in solution in the sea.
From these salts is derived the calcium deposited as
calcium carbonate to form the shells of the Foraminifera
and the larger shells in the Chalk. There is also silica in
small quantity in sea water. From this the skeletons of
radiolaria and diatoms and the spicules of sponges are
formed. Now, many flints contain fossil sponges, and
when broken show a section of the sponge clearly marked.
Especially well can this be seen in flints which have lain
some time in a gravel bed formed of flints worn out of the
chalk by denudation. Hard as a flint seems, it is penetrated
by numerous fine pores. The gravel beds are usually stained
yellow by water containing iron, and this has penetrated by
the pores through the substance of the flints, staining them
brown and orange. Many of the stained flints show beautifully
the sponge markings,&mdash;a wide central canal with
fine thread-like canals leading into it from all sides.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_48" id="Page_48">[Pg&nbsp;48]</a></span>
The Chalk Sea evidently abounded in siliceous organisms,
and it cannot be doubted that it is from such
organisms that the silica was derived, which has formed
the masses of flint. Silica occurs in two forms&mdash;in a
crystalline form as quartz or rock crystal, and as amorphous,
<i>i.e.</i>, formless or uncrystalline (also called opaline)
silica. The siliceous skeletons of marine organisms are
formed of amorphous silica. Flint consists of innumerable
fine crystalline grains, closely packed together.
Amorphous silica is less stable than crystalline, and is
capable of being dissolved in alkaline water, <i>i.e.</i>, water
containing carbonate of sodium or potassium in solution.
If the silica so dissolved be deposited again, it is generally
in the crystalline form. It seems probable, therefore,
that the amorphous silica of the skeletal parts of marine
organisms has been dissolved by alkaline water percolating
through the strata, and re-deposited as flint.</p>

<p>As the silica was deposited, chalk was removed. The
large irregular masses of flint lying in the Chalk strata
have clearly taken the place of chalk which has been
removed. Water charged with silica soaking through the
strata has deposited silica, and at the same time dissolved
out so much carbonate of lime. Bivalve shells, originally
carbonate of lime, are often replaced, and filled up by
flint, and casts of sea urchins in solid flint are common,
and often beautiful fossils. This process of change took
place after the foraminiferal ooze had been compacted into
chalk strata; and to some extent at any rate, there has
been deposition of silica after the chalk had become hard
and solid; for we find flat sheets, called tabular flint,
lying along the strata, or filling cracks cutting through
the strata at right angles. But in all probability the
re-arrangement of the constituents of the strata took
place in the main during the first consolidation, as the
strata rose above the sea-level, and the sea-water drained
out. A suggestion has been made by R. E. Liesegang,
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_49" id="Page_49">[Pg&nbsp;49]</a></span>
of Dresden, to explain the occurrence of the flints in the
bands with clear interspaces between, which are such a
marked feature of the Upper Chalk. He has shown how
"a solution diffusing outward and encountering something
with which it reacts and forms a precipitate, moves on
into this medium until a concentration sufficient to cause
precipitation of the particular salt occurs. A zone of
precipitation is thus formed, through which the first
solution penetrates until the conditions are repeated, and
a second zone of precipitate is thrown down. Zone after
zone may thus arise as diffusion goes on." He suggests
that the zones of flint may be similar phenomena, water
diffusing through the masses of chalk taking up silica till
such concentration is reached that precipitation takes
place, the water then percolating further and repeating
the process.<a name="FNanchor_A_8" id="FNanchor_A_8"></a><a href="#Footnote_A_8" class="fnanchor">[8]</a></p>

<p>The precipitation of silica and replacement of the chalk
occurs irregularly along the zone of precipitation, forming
great irregular masses of flint, which enclose the sponges
and other marine organisms that lay in the chalk strata.
Where a deposit of silica has begun, it will probably have
determined the precipitation of more silica, in the manner
constantly seen in chemical precipitation; and it would
seem that siliceous organisms as sponges have to some
extent served as centres around which silica has been
precipitated, for flints are very commonly found, having
the evident external form of sponges.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_50" id="Page_50">[Pg&nbsp;50]</a></span>
It will be well to say something here of the history of
the flints as the chalk which contains them is gradually
denuded away. Rain water containing carbonic dioxide
has a great effect in eating away all limestone rocks, chalk
included. A vast extent of chalk, which formerly covered
much of England has thus disappeared. The arch of
chalk connecting our two ranges of downs has been cut
through, and from the top of the downs themselves a
great thickness of chalk has been removed. The chalk in
the downs above Ventnor and Bonchurch is nearly
horizontal. It consists of Lower and Middle Chalk; and
probably a small bit of the Upper occurs. But the top
of St. Boniface Down is covered with a great mass of
angular flint gravel, which must have come from the
Upper Chalk. The gravel is of considerable thickness,
perhaps 20&nbsp;ft., and on the spurs of the down falls over to
a lower level like a table-cloth. It is worked in many
pits for road metal. This flint gravel represents the insoluble
residue which has been left when the Chalk was
dissolved away.</p>

<p>On the top of the cliffs between Ventnor and Bonchurch,
at a point called Highport, is a stratum of flint
gravel carried down from the top of the down. The shore
here is strewn with large flints fallen from the gravel.
The substance of many of the flints has undergone a
remarkable change. Instead of black or dull grey flint it
has become translucent agate, of splendid orange and
purple colours, or has been changed into clear translucent
chalcedony. In the agate the forms of fossil sponges can
often be beautifully seen. The colours are due to iron-charged
water percolating into the flint in the gravel bed,
but further structural changes have altered the form of
the silica; chalcedony having a structure of close crystalline
fibres, revealed by polarized light: when variously
stained and coloured, it is usually called agate. Many of
these flints, when cut through and polished, are of great
beauty. The main force of the tides along these shores
is from west to east; and so there is a continual passage
of pebbles on the shore in that direction. The flints in
Sandown Bay have in the main travelled round from
here; and towards the Culvers small handy specimens
of agates and chalcedonies rounded by the waves may
be collected.</p>

The extensive downs in the centre of the Island
are largely overspread with angular flint gravel
similarly formed to that of St. Boniface. Of other
beds of gravel, which have been washed down to a
lower level by rivers or other agency we shall have more
to say later.</p>

<p>The Chalk strata in the Isle of Wight are of great thickness.
In the Culver Cliff there are some 400 feet of flintless
Chalk (Lower and Middle Chalk), and then some
1,000 feet of chalk with flints. There is some variation
in the thickness of the strata in different parts of the
Island, and the amount of the Upper strata, which has
been removed by denudation, varies considerably. The
average thickness of the white chalk in the Island is about
1,350 feet.<a name="FNanchor_A_9" id="FNanchor_A_9"></a><a href="#Footnote_A_9" class="fnanchor">[9]</a> Including the Lower Chalk, the maximum
thickness of the Chalk strata is 1,630&nbsp;ft.</p>

<p>The divisions of the chalk we have so far considered
depend on the character of the rock: we must say
a word about another way of dividing the strata.
It is found that in the chalk, as in other strata,
fossils change with every few feet of deposit. We may make
a zoological division of the chalk by seeing how the fossils
are distributed. The Chalk was first studied from this
point of view by the great French geologist, M. Barrois,
who divided it into zones, according to the nature of the
animal life, the zones being called by the name of some
fossil specially characteristic of a particular zone. More
recently Dr. A. W. Rowe has made a very careful study
of the zones of the White Chalk, and is now our chief
authority on the subject. The strata have been grouped
into zones as follows:&mdash;</p>

<p>The method of study according to zoological zones is
of great interest. The period of the White Chalk was of
long duration, and the physical conditions remained very
uniform. So that by studying the succession of life during
this period we may learn much about the gradual change
of life on the earth, and the evolution of living things.</p>

<p>We have seen that the whole mass of the chalk is made
up mainly of the remains of living things,&mdash;mostly of the
microscopic foraminifera. We have seen that sponges
were very plentiful in that ancient sea. Of other fossils
we find brachiopods&mdash;different species of Terebratula and
Rhynchonella&mdash;a large bivalve <i>Inoceramus</i> sometimes
very common; the very beautiful bivalve, <i>Spondylus
spinosus</i>, belemnites, serpul&aelig;; and different species of
sea-urchin are very common. A pretty heart-shaped one,
<i>Micraster cor-anguinum</i>, marks a zone of the higher chalk,
which runs along the top of our northern downs. Other
common sea urchins are various species of <i>Cidaris</i>, of a
form like a turban (Gk. <i>cidaris</i>, a Persian head-dress);
<i>Cyphosoma</i>, another circular form; the oval <i>Echinocorys</i>
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_53" id="Page_53">[Pg&nbsp;53]</a></span>
<i>scutatus</i>, which, with varieties of the same and allied
species, abounds in the Upper Chalk, and the more conical
<i>Conulus conicus</i>. The topmost zone, that of <i>B. Macronata</i>,
would yield a record of exuberant life, were the
chalk soft and horizontal. There was a rich development
of echinoderms (sea urchins and star fishes), but nothing
is perfect, owing to the hardness of the rock (Dr. Rowe).
The general difference in the life of the Chalk period is
the great development of Ammonites and other Cephalopods
in the Lower Chalk, and of sea urchins and other
echinoderms in the Upper, while the Middle Chalk is
wanting in the one and the other. Shark's teeth tell of
the larger inhabitants of the ocean that flowed above the
chalky bottom.</p>

<p>Many quarries have been opened on the flanks of the
Chalk Downs, of which a large number are now disused.
They occur just where they are needed for chalk to lay
on the land, the pure chalk on the north of the Downs to
break up the heavy Tertiary clays, which largely cover
the north of the Island; the more clayey beds of the Grey
Chalk on the south of the downs to stiffen the light loams
of the Greensand.<a name="FNanchor_A_10" id="FNanchor_A_10"></a><a href="#Footnote_A_10" class="fnanchor">[10]</a></p>

<div class="chapt_hdr">Chapter VIII</div>

<div class="chapt_ttl">THE TERTIARY ERA: THE EOCENE</div>

<p>Ages must have passed while the ocean flowed over this
part of the world, and the chalk mud, with its varied
remains of living things, gradually accumulated at the
bottom. At last a change came. Slowly the sea bed
rose, till the chalk, now hardened by pressure, was raised
into land above the sea level. As soon as this happened,
sea waves and rain and rivers began to cut it down.
There is evidence here of a wide gap in the succession of
the strata. Higher chalk strata, which probably once
existed, have been washed away, while the underlying
strata have been planed off to an even surface more or
less oblique to the bedding-planes. The highest zone of
the chalk in the Island (that of <i>Belemnitella macronata</i>)
varies greatly in thickness, from 150&nbsp;ft. at the eastern end
of the Island to 475 at the western. The latest investigations
give reason to conclude that this is due to gentle
synclines and anticlines, which have been planed smooth
by the erosion which preceded the deposition of the next
strata,&mdash;the Eocene.<a name="FNanchor_A_11" id="FNanchor_A_11"></a><a href="#Footnote_A_11" class="fnanchor">[11]</a> At Alum Bay the eroded surface
of the chalk may be seen with rolled flints lying upon it,
and rounded hollows or pot-holes, the appearance being
that of a foreshore worn in a horizontal ledge of rock,
much like the Horse Ledge at Shanklin.</p>

<p>The land sank again, but not to anything like the depth
of the great Chalk Sea. We now come to an era called
the Tertiary. The whole geological history is divided
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_55" id="Page_55">[Pg&nbsp;55]</a></span>
into four great eras. The first is the Eozoic, or the age
of the Arch&aelig;an,&mdash;often called Pre-Cambrian&mdash;rocks;
rocks largely volcanic, or greatly altered since their
formation, showing only obscure traces of the life which
no doubt existed. Then follow the Primary era, or, as
it is generally called, the Pal&aelig;ozoic; the Secondary or
Mesozoic; and the Tertiary or Kainozoic. Pal&aelig;ozoic is
used rather than Primary, as this word is ambiguous,
being also used for the crystalline rocks first formed by
the solidification of the molten surface of the earth.
But Secondary and Tertiary are still in constant use.
These long ages, or eras, were of very unequal duration;
yet they mark such changes in the life of animal and
plant upon the earth that they form natural divisions.
The Pal&aelig;ozoic was an immense period during which life
abounded in the seas,&mdash;numberless species of mollusca,
crustaceans, corals, fish are found,&mdash;and there were great
forests, which have formed the coal measures, on land,&mdash;forests
of strange primeval vegetation, but in which
beautiful ferns, large and small, flourished in great
numbers. The Secondary Era may be called the age of
reptiles. To this era all the rocks we have so far studied
belong. Now we come to the last era, the Tertiary, the
age of the mammals. Instead of reptiles on land, in sea
and air, we find a complete change. The earth is occupied
by the mammalia; the air belongs to the birds such
as we see to-day. The strange birds of the Oolitic
and Cretaceous have passed away. Birds have taken
their modern form. In some parts of the world
strata are found transitional between the Secondary and
Tertiary.</p>

<p>The Tertiary is divided into four divisions,&mdash;the Eocene,
the Oligocene (once called Upper Eocene), the Miocene,
and the Pliocene; which words signify,&mdash;Pliocene the
more recent period, Miocene the less recent, Eocene the
dawn of the recent.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_56" id="Page_56">[Pg&nbsp;56]</a></span>
In the Eocene we shall find marine deposits of a comparatively
shallow sea, and beds deposited at the mouth
of great rivers, where remains of sea creatures are mingled
with those washed down from the land by the rivers.
These strata run through the Isle of Wight from east to
west, and we may study them at either end of the Island,
in Whitecliff and Alum Bays. The strata are highly
inclined, so that we can walk across them in a short walk.
Some beds contain many fossils, but many of the shells
are very brittle and crumbly; and we can only secure
good specimens by cutting out a piece of the clay or sand
containing them, and transferring them carefully to
boxes, to be carried home with equal care. Often much
of the face of the cliff is covered with slip or rainwash,
and overgrown with vegetation. Sometimes a large slip
exposes a good hunting ground.</p>

<p>Now let us walk along the shore, and try to read the
story these Tertiary beds tell us. We will begin in
Whitecliff Bay. Though easily accessible, it remains still
in its natural beauty. The sea washes in on a fine stretch
of smooth sand sheltered by the white chalk wall which
forms the south arm of the bay. North of the Culver
downs the cliffs are much lower, and consist of sands and
clays of varying colour, following each other in vertical
bands. Looking along the line of shore we notice a band
of limestone, at first nearly vertical like the preceding
strata, then curving at a sharp angle as it slopes to the
shore, and running out to sea in a reef known as Bembridge
Ledge. This is the Bembridge limestone; and
the beginning of the reef marks the northern boundary of
Whitecliff Bay, the shore, however, continuing in nearly
the same line to Bembridge Foreland, and showing a
continuous succession of Eocene and Oligocene strata.
The strata north of the limestone are nearly horizontal,
dipping slightly to the north. In the Bembridge limestone
we see the end of the Sandown anticline, and the
beginning of the succeeding syncline. The strata now
dip under the Solent, and rise into another anticline in
the Portsdown Hills. North and south of the great
anticline of the Weald of Kent and Sussex are two synclinal
troughs known as the London and Hampshire
basins. Nearly the whole of our English Eocene strata
lies in these two basins, having been denuded away from
the anticlinal arches. The Oligocene only occur in the
Hampshire basin, the higher strata only in the Isle of
Wight.</p>

Above the Chalk we come first to a thick red clay called
Plastic clay. It is much slipped, and the slip is overgrown.
The only fossils found in the Island are fragments
of plants; larger plant remains on the mainland show a
temperate climate. This clay was formerly worked at
Newport for pottery. The clay is probably a freshwater
deposit formed in fairly deep water. On the mainland
we find on the border shallow water deposits called the
Woolwich and Reading beds. (The clay is 150 to 160&nbsp;ft.
thick at Whitecliff Bay, less than 90&nbsp;ft. at the Alum Bay.)
We come next to a considerable thickness of dark clay
with sand, at the surface turned brown by weathering.
This is the London clay, so called because it underlies the
area on which London is built. At the base is a band of
rounded flint pebbles, which extends at the base of the
clay from here to Suffolk. In it, as well as in a hard
sandstone 18 inches higher up, are tubular shells of a
marine worm, <i>Ditrupa plana</i>. The sandstone runs out
on the shore. About 35&nbsp;ft. above the basement bed is a
zone of <i>Panop&aelig;a intermedia</i> and <i>Pholadomya margaritacea</i>,
at 50&nbsp;ft. another band of <i>Ditrupa</i>, and at about
80&nbsp;ft. a band with a small <i>Cardita</i>. In the higher part of
the clay are large septaria,&mdash;rounded blocks of a calcareous
clay-ironstone, with cracks running through them
filled with spar. <i>Pinna affinis</i> is found in the septaria.
The thickness of the clay in Whitecliff Bay is 322 feet.

It can be seen on the shore, when the tide happens to
have swept the sand away. Otherwise the lower beds are
hardly visible, there being no cliff here, but a slope overgrown
with vegetation.</p>

<p>In Alum Bay the London clay, about 400&nbsp;ft. in thickness,
consists of clays, chiefly dark blue, with sands, and
lines of septaria. In the lower part is a dark clay with
<i>Pholadomya margaritacea</i>, still preserving the pearly
nacre. There are also <i>Panop&aelig;a intermedia</i>, and in septaria
<i>Pinna affinis</i>. All these with their pearly lustre,
are beautiful fossils. A little higher is a zone with
<i>Ditrupa</i>, and further on a band of <i>Cardita</i>. Other shells
also are found in the clay, especially in the lower part.
They are all marine, and indicate a sub-tropical climate.
Lines of pebbles show that we are near a beach. In other
parts of the south of England remains from the land are
found, borne down an ancient river in the way we found
before in the Wealden deposits.</p>

<p>But times have changed since the Wealden days, and
the life of the Tertiary times has a much more modern
appearance. From leaves and fruits borne down from
the forest we can learn clearly the nature of the early
Eocene land and climate. Leaves are found at Newhaven,
and numerous fossil fruits at Sheppey. The character of
the vegetation most resembled that now to be seen in India,
South Eastern Asia, and Australia. Palms grew luxuriantly,
the most abundant fruit being that of one called
Nipadites, from its resemblance to the Nipa palm, which
grows on the banks of rivers in India and the Philippines.
The forests also included plants allied to cypresses,
banksia, maples, poplars, mimosa, custard apples, gourds,
and melons. The rivers abounded in turtle&mdash;large
numbers of remains of which are found in the London
clay at the mouth of the Thames&mdash;crocodiles and alligators.
With the exception of the south east of England,
all the British Isles formed part of a continental mass of
land covered with a tropical vegetation. The mountain
chains of England, Scotland, and Wales rose as now, but
higher. Long denudation has worn them down since.
In the south-east of England the coast line fluctuated;
and sea shells, and the remains of the plant and animal
life of the neighbourhood of a great tropical river alternate
in the deposits.</p>

The London clay is succeeded by a great thickness of
sands and clays which form the Bagshot series. These
are divided in the London basin into Lower, Middle, and
Upper Bagshot. In the Hampshire basin the strata are
now classified as Bagshot Sands, Bracklesham Beds,
Barton Beds, the last comprising the Barton Clay and the
Barton Sand, formerly termed Headon Hill Sands. There
is some uncertainty as to the manner in which these correspond
to the beds of the Bagshot district, as the Tertiary
strata have been divided by denudation into two groups,
and differ in character in the two areas. It is possible
that the Barton Sand represents a later deposit than
any in the London area.</p>

<p>Almost the only fossil remains in the Bagshot Sands
are those of plants, but these are of great interest. In
Whitecliff Bay the beds consist for the most part of
yellow sands, above which is a band of flint pebbles, which
has been taken as the base of the Bracklesham series, for
in the clay immediately above marine shells occur. The
Bagshot Sands, in Whitecliff Bay, are about 138 feet
thick, in Alum Bay, 76 feet, according to the latest
classification. In Alum Bay the strata consist of sands,
yellow, grey, white, and crimson, with clays, and bands
of pipe clay. This is remarkably white and pure, as
though derived from white felspar, like the China clay in
Cornwall. The pipe clay contains leaves of trees, sometimes
beautifully preserved. Specimens are not very
easy to obtain, as only the edges of the leaves appear at
the surface of the cliff. They have been found chiefly
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_60" id="Page_60">[Pg&nbsp;60]</a></span>
in a pocket, or thickening of the seam of pipe clay, which
for forty years yielded specimens abundantly, afterwards
thinning out, when the leaves became rare. The leaves
lie flat, as they drifted and settled down in a pool. With
them are the twigs of a conifer, occasionally a fruit or
flower, or the wing case of a beetle. The leaves show a
tropical climate. The flora is a local one, differing considerably
from those of Eocene deposits elsewhere. The
plants are nearly all dicotyledons. Of palms there are
only a few fragments, while the London clay of Sheppey
is rich in palm fruits, and many large palms are found
in the Bournemouth leaf beds, corresponding in date to
the Bracklesham. The differences may be largely due to
conditions of locality and deposition. The Alum Bay
flora is characterised by a wealth of leguminous plants,
and large leaves of species of fig (<i>Ficus</i>); simple laurel
and willow-like leaves are common, of which it is difficult
to determine the species, and there is abundance of a
species of <i>Aralia</i>. The character of the flora resembles
most those of Central America and the Malay Archipelago.</p>

The Bracklesham Beds in Alum Bay (570&nbsp;ft. thick)
consist of clays, with lignite forming bands 6&nbsp;in. to 2&nbsp;ft.
thick; white, yellow, and crimson sands; and in the
upper part dark sandy clays, with bands showing impressions
of marine fossils. Alum Bay takes its name from
the alum formerly manufactured from the Tertiary clays.
The coloured sands have made the bay famous. The colours
of the sands when freshly exposed, and of the cliffs when wet
with rain, are very rich and beautiful,&mdash;deep purple, crimson,
yellow, white, and grey. Some of the beds are finely
striped in different shades by current bedding. The
contrast of these coloured cliffs with the White Chalk,
weathered to a soft grey, of the other half of the bay is
very striking and beautiful. About 45&nbsp;ft. from the top is
a conglomerate of flint pebbles, some of large size,
cemented by iron oxide. In Whitecliff Bay the Bracklesham
Beds (585&nbsp;ft.) consist of clays, sands, and sandy
clays, mostly dark, greenish and blue in colour, containing
marine fossils and lignite. Sir Richard Worsley, in his
History of the Isle of Wight, tells that in February, 1773,
a bed of coal was laid bare in Whitecliff Bay, causing
great excitement in the neighbourhood. People flocked
to the shore for coal, but it proved worthless as fuel. It
has, however, been worked to some extent in later years.
In some of the beds are many fossils. Numbers have
lately been visible where a large founder has taken place.
There are large shells of <i>Cardita planicosta</i> and <i>Turritella
imbricataria</i>. They are, however, very fragile. In a
stratum just above these are numbers of a large Nummulite
(<i>Nummulites l&aelig;vigatus</i>). These are round flat shells
like coins,&mdash;hence the name (Lat. <i>nummus</i>, a coin). They
are a large species of foraminifera. We may split them
with a penknife; and then we see a pretty spiral of tiny
chambers. A smaller variety, <i>N. variolarius</i>, occurs a
little further on, and a tiny kind, <i>N. elegans</i>, in the
Barton clay. One of the most striking features of
the later Eocene is the immense development of
Nummulite limestones&mdash;vast beds built up of the
delicate chambered shells of Nummulites,&mdash;which extend
from the Alps and Carpathians into Thibet, and from
Morocco, Algeria, and Egypt, through Afghanistan and
the Himalaya to China. The pyramids of Egypt are
built of this limestone.</p>

<p>The Bracklesham beds are followed by the Barton clay,
famous for the number of beautiful fossil shells found
at Barton on the Hampshire coast. At Whitecliff Bay
the fossils are, unfortunately, very friable. At Alum
Bay the pathway to the shore is in a gully in the upper
part of the Barton clay. The strata consist of clays,
sands, and sandy clays. The base of the beds is marked
by the zone of <i>Nummulites elegans</i>. Numerous very
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_62" id="Page_62">[Pg&nbsp;62]</a></span>
pretty shells of the smaller Barton types may be found,
with fragments of larger ones; or a whole one may be
found. Owing to the cliff section cutting straight across
the strata, which are nearly vertical, there is far less of
the beds open to observation than at Barton, which
probably accounts for the list of fossils being much smaller.
The shells are chiefly several species of <i>Pleurotoma</i>, <i>Rostellaria</i>,
<i>Fusus</i>, <i>Voluta</i>, <i>Turritella</i>, <i>Natica</i>, a small bivalve
<i>Corbula pisum</i>, a tubular shell of a sand-boring mollusc
<i>Dentalium</i>, <i>Ostr&#339;a</i>, <i>Pecten</i>, <i>Cardium</i>, <i>Crassatella</i>. The
fauna is like a blending of Malayan and New Zealand
forms of marine life. Throughout the Eocene from the
London clay onward the shells are such as abound in the
warm sea south east of Asia. Similarly the plant remains
take us into a tropic land, where fan palms and feather
palms overshadowed the country, trees of the tropics
mingling with trees we still find in more Northern latitudes.
The general character of the flora as of the shells was
Oriental and Malayan; both being succeeded in later
strata by a flora and fauna with greater analogy to that
now existing in Western North America.</p>

<p>In Alum Bay the Barton clay is suddenly succeeded
by the very fine yellow and white sands which run along
the western base of Headon Hill, the curve of the syncline
bringing them round from a nearly vertical to an almost
horizontal position. These are now known as the Barton
Sand. They are 90&nbsp;ft. thick, the whole of the Barton
beds being 338&nbsp;ft. in Alum Bay, 368&nbsp;ft. in Whitecliff.
The sands were formerly extensively used for glass making.
They are almost unfossiliferous. The passage from Barton
clay to the sands in Whitecliff Bay is more gradual. The
sands here show some fine colouring which reminds us of
the more celebrated sands of Alum Bay.</p>

<div class="chapt_hdr">Chapter IX</div>

<div class="chapt_ttl">THE OLIGOCENE</div>

<p>We pass on to strata which used to be called Upper
Eocene, but are now generally classified as a period by
themselves, and called the Oligocene. They are also
known as the Fluvio-marine series. Large part was
deposited in freshwater by rivers running into lagoons,
or in the brackish water of estuaries, while at times the
sea encroached, and beds of marine origin were laid down.</p>

<p>The west of the Island is much the best locality for the
lower strata, those which take their name from Headon
Hill between Alum and Totland Bays. There are three
divisions of the Headon strata, marine beds in the middle
coming between upper and lower beds formed in fresh
and brackish water. Light green clays are very characteristic
of these beds, and at the west of the Island thick
freshwater limestones, which have died out before the
strata re-appear in Whitecliff Bay. The strongest masses
of limestone in Headon Hill belong to the Upper division.
The limestones are full of freshwater shells, nearly all the
long spiral Limn&aelig;a and the flat spiral disc of Planorbis,
perhaps the most abundant species being <i>L. longiscata</i>
and <i>P. euomphalus</i>. The limestones themselves are almost
entirely the produce of a freshwater plant <i>Chara</i>, which
precipitates lime on its tissues, in the same manner as the
sea weeds we call corallines. On the shore round the base
of Headon Hill lie numerous blocks of limestone, the
d&eacute;bris of strata fallen in confusion, in which are beautiful
specimens of Limn&aelig;a and Planorbis. The shells, however,
are very fragile. The marine beds of the Middle Headon
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_64" id="Page_64">[Pg&nbsp;64]</a></span>
are best seen in Colwell Bay, where a few yards north
of How Ledge they descend to the beach, and a cliff
is seen formed of a thick bed of oysters, <i>Ostrea velata</i>.
The oysters occupy a hollow eroded in a sandy clay
full of <i>Cytherea incrassata</i>, from which the bed is known
as the "Venus" bed, the shell formerly being called
<i>Venus</i>, later <i>Cytherea</i>, at present <i>Meretrix</i>. The marine
beds contain many drifted freshwater shells as Limn&aelig;a
and Cyrena. The How Ledge limestone forms the top
of the Lower Headon. It is full of well-preserved
Limn&aelig;a and Planorbis.</p>

<p>The Upper and Lower Headon are mainly fresh or
brackish water deposits. The purely freshwater beds
contain <i>Limn&aelig;a</i>, <i>Planorbis</i>, <i>Paludina</i>, <i>Unio</i>, and land-shells.
In the brackish are found <i>Potamomya</i>, <i>Cyrena</i>,
<i>Cerithium</i> (<i>Potamides</i>), <i>Melania</i> and <i>Melanopsis</i>. <i>Paludina
lenta</i> is very abundant throughout the Oligocene.
A large number of the marine shells of the Headon beds
are species also found in the Barton clay. <i>Cytherea</i>,
<i>Voluta</i>, <i>Ancillaria</i>, <i>Pleurotoma</i>, <i>Natica</i> are purely marine
genera.</p>

<p>In White Cliff Bay the beds are mostly estuarine. Most
of the fossils are found in two bands, one about 30&nbsp;ft.
above the base of the series, the other a stiff blue clay,
about 90 feet higher, which seems to correspond with the
"Venus Bed" of Colwell Bay. Many of the fossils are of
Barton types.</p>

<p>The Headon beds are about 150 feet thick at Headon
Hill, 212&nbsp;ft. in Whitecliff Bay; and are followed by beds
varying from about 80 to 110&nbsp;ft. in thickness, known as
the Osborne and St. Helens series. They consist mainly
of marls variously coloured, with sandstone and limestone.
In Headon Hill is a thick concretionary limestone,
which almost disappears northward. The Oligocene
strata often vary considerably within short distances.
The Osborne beds are exposed along the low shore between
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_65" id="Page_65">[Pg&nbsp;65]</a></span>
Cowes and Ryde, and from Sea View to St. Helens. In
Whitecliff Bay they are not well seen, occurring in overgrown
slopes. They consist mostly of red and green clays.
A band of cream-yellow limestone a foot thick is the most
conspicuous feature. The fossils resemble those from
the Headon beds, but are much less plentiful. The marls
seem to have been mostly deposited in lagoons of brackish
water, which at the present day are favourite places for
turtles and alligators, and of these many remains are
found in the Osborne beds. The beds are specially noted
for the shoals of small fish, <i>Diplomystus vectensis</i> (<i>Clupea</i>),
first observed by Mr. G. W. Colenutt, F.G.S., and
prawns found in them, and also remains of plants.
The beds that appear in the neighbourhood of Sea
View and St. Helens are divided into Nettlestone Grits
and St. Helen's Sands, the former containing a freestone
8 feet thick.</p>

<p>Above these beds lies the Bembridge limestone, which
is so conspicuous in Whitecliff Bay, and forms Bembridge
Ledge. On the north shore of the Island the strata rise
slightly on the northern side of the syncline. There are
also minor undulations in an east and west direction.
The result is to bring up the Bembridge limestone at
various points along the north shore, where it forms
conspicuous ledges&mdash;Hamstead Ledge at the mouth of
the Newtown river, ledges in Thorness Bay, and Gurnard
Ledge. In Whitecliff Bay the limestone, about 25 feet
thick, forms the conspicuous reef called Bembridge Ledge.
The Bembridge limestone consists of two or more bands
of limestone with intercalated clays. It is usually whiter
than the Headon limestones, and the fossils occur as casts,
the shells being sometimes replaced by calc-spar. The
limestone has been much used as a building stone for
centuries, not only in the Island, but for buildings on the
mainland. The most famous quarries were those near
Binstead, from which Quarr, the site of the great Abbey,
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_66" id="Page_66">[Pg&nbsp;66]</a></span>
now almost entirely disappeared, derives its name. From
these quarries was obtained much of the stone for Winchester
Cathedral and many other ancient buildings. In
the old walls and buildings of Southampton the stone may
be recognised at once by the casts of the Limn&aelig;ae it
contains. The quarries at Quarr were noted in more ways
than one. In later times the remains of early mammalia,&mdash;Pal&aelig;otherium,
Anoplotherium, and others&mdash;have been
found. The quarries are now abandoned and overgrown.
The limestone may be seen inland at Brading, where it
forms the ridge on which the Church stands.</p>

<p>The limestone is a freshwater formation, and the fossils
are mostly freshwater shells, of the same type as the
Headon, Limn&aelig;a and Planorbis the most common.
There are also land shells, especially several species of
Helix, the genus which includes the common snail,&mdash;<i>H.
globosa</i>, very large,&mdash;and great species of <i>Bulimus</i> (<i>Amphidromus</i>)
and <i>Achatina</i> (<i>B. Ellipticus</i>, <i>A. costellata</i>).
These interesting shells were chiefly obtained in the limestone
at Sconce near Yarmouth, a locality now inaccessible,
being occupied by fortifications. The land shells have an
affinity to species now found in Southern North America.
The limestone also abounds in the so-called "seeds" of
Chara. The reproductive organs,&mdash;the "seeds,"&mdash;of
this curious water-plant, allied to the lower Alg&aelig;, are, like
the rest of the plant, encased in carbonate of lime, and
are very durable. Large numbers are found in the
Oligocene strata. Under the microscope they are seen
to be beautifully sculptured in various designs, with a
delicate spiral running round them. Above the limestone
lie the Bembridge marls, varying in thickness in different
localities from 70 to 120 feet. North of Whitecliff Bay
they stretch on to the Foreland. They are in the main
a freshwater formation, but a few feet above the limestone
is a marine band with oysters, <i>Ostrea Vectensis</i>. It runs
out along the shore, where the oysters may be seen covering
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_67" id="Page_67">[Pg&nbsp;67]</a></span>
the surface. The Lower Marls consist chiefly of variously-coloured
clays with many shells, chiefly <i>Cyrena pulchra</i>,
<i>semistriata</i>, and <i>obovata</i>, <i>Cerithium mutabile</i>, and <i>Melania
muricata</i> (<i>acuta</i>); and red and green marls, in which are
few shells, but fragments of turtle occur. A little above
the oyster bed is a band of hard-bluish septarian limestone.
Sixty years ago Edward Forbes remarked on the resemblance
of this band to the harder insect-bearing
limestones of the Purbeck beds. In a limestone exactly
resembling this, and similarly situated in the lower part
of the marls in Gurnard and Thorness Bays, numerous
insects were afterwards found,&mdash;beetles, flies, locusts, and
dragonflies, and spiders. Leaves of plants, including
palms, fig, and cinnamon, have also been found in this
bed, showing that the climate was still sub-tropical.
The upper Marls consist chiefly of grey clays with abundance
of <i>Melania turritissima</i> (<i>Potamaclis</i>). The chief
shells in the marls are <i>Cyrena</i>, <i>Melania</i>, <i>Melanopsis</i>
and <i>Paludina</i> (<i>Viviparus</i>). They are often beautifully
preserved; the species of Cyrena often retain their colour-markings.</p>

<p>Bembridge Foreland is formed by a thick bed of flint
gravel resting on the marls, which are seen again in Priory
Bay, where in winter they flow over the sea-wall in a semi-liquid
condition. They lie above the limestone at Gurnard,
Thorness, and Hamstead. West of Hamstead Ledge
the whole of the beds crop out on the shore, where beautifully
preserved fossils may be collected. Large pieces of
drift wood occur, also seeds and fruit. Many fragments
of turtle plates may be found. Large crystals of selenite
(sulphate of lime) occur in the Marls.</p>

<p>Last of the Oligocene in the Isle of Wight are the
Hamstead beds. These strata are peculiar to the Isle of
Wight. The Bembridge beds also are not found on the
mainland, except a small outlier at Creechbarrow Hill
in Dorset. The Hamstead beds consist of some 250 feet
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_68" id="Page_68">[Pg&nbsp;68]</a></span>
of marls, in which many interesting fossils have been
found. They cover a large area of the northern part of
the Island, largely overlaid by gravels, and are only seen
on the coast at Hamstead, where they form the greater
part of the cliff, which reaches a height of 210&nbsp;ft., the top
being capped by gravel. In winter the clays become
semi-liquid, in summer the surface may be largely slip
and rainwash, baked hard by the sun. The lower part
of the strata may be best seen on the shore. The strata
consist of 225&nbsp;ft. of freshwater, estuarine, and lagoon
beds, with <i>Unio</i>, <i>Cyrena</i>, <i>Cyclas</i>, <i>Paludina</i>, <i>Hydrobia</i>,
<i>Melania</i>, <i>Planorbis</i>, <i>Cerithium</i> (rare), and remains of
turtles, crocodiles, and mammals, leaves and seeds of
plants; and above these beds 31 feet of marine beds with
<i>Corbula</i>, <i>Cytherea</i>, <i>Ostrea callifera</i>, <i>Cuma</i>, <i>Voluta</i>, <i>Natica</i>,
<i>Cerithium</i>, and <i>Melania</i>.</p>

<p>Except for the convenience of dividing so large a mass
of strata, it would not be necessary to divide these from
the Bembridge beds, as no break in the character of the
life of the period occurs at the junction. The basement
bed of the Hamstead strata is known as the Black Band,
2 feet of clay, coloured black with vegetable matter, with
<i>Paludina lenta</i> very numerous, <i>Melanopsis carinata</i>,
<i>Limn&aelig;a</i>, <i>Planorbis</i>, a small <i>Cyclas</i> (<i>C. Bristovii</i>), seed
vessels, and lumps of lignite. It rests on dark green marls
with <i>Paludina lenta</i> and <i>Melanopsis</i>, and full of roots.
This evidently marks an old land surface. About 65 feet
higher is the White Band,&mdash;a white and green clay full
of shells, mostly broken. There are bands of tabular
ironstone containing <i>Paludina lenta</i>. Clay ironstone was
formerly collected on the shore between Yarmouth and
Hamstead and sent to Swansea to be smelted. The
strata consist largely of mottled green and red clays,
probably deposited in brackish lagoons. These yield
few fossils except remains of turtle and crocodile and drifted
plants. The blue clays are much more fossiliferous.
Among other plants are leaves of palm and water-lily.
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_69" id="Page_69">[Pg&nbsp;69]</a></span>
The strata gradually become more marine upwards.
The marine beds were called by Forbes the Corbula beds,
from two small shells, <i>C. pisum</i> and <i>C. vectensis</i>, of which
some of the clays are full. Remains of early mammalia
are found in the Hamstead beds, the most frequent being
a hog-like animal, of supposed aquatic habits, Hyopotamus,
of which there are more than one species.</p>

<p>The fauna and flora of the Oligocene strata show that
the climate was still sub-tropical, though somewhat
cooling down from the Eocene. Palms grew in what is now
the Isle of Wight. Alligators and crocodiles swam in the
rivers. Turtle were abundant in river and lagoon.
Specially interesting in the Eocene and Oligocene are the
mammalian remains. They show us mammals in an
early stage before they branched off into the various
families as we know them to-day. The Pal&aelig;otherium
was an animal like the tapir, now an inhabitant of the
warmer <a name="regions"></a><a href="#typos">regions</a> of Asia and America. Recent discoveries
in Eocene strata in Egypt show stages of development
between a tapir-like animal and the elephant with long
trunk and tusks. There were in those days hog-like
animals intermediate between the hogs and the hippopotami.
There were ancestors of the horse with three toes
on each foot. There were hornless ancestors of the deer
and antelopes. Many of the early mammals showed
characters now found in the marsupials, the order to which
the Kangaroo and Opossum belong, members of which
are found in rocks of the Secondary Era, and are the only
representatives of the mammalia in that age. Some of
the early Eocene mammalia are either marsupials, or
closely related to them. In the Oligocene we find the
mammalian life becoming more varied, and branching out
into the various groups we know to-day; while the
succeeding Miocene Period witnesses the culmination of
the mammalia&mdash;mammals of every family abounding all
over the earth's surface, in a profusion and variety not
seen before&mdash;or since, outside the tropics.</p>

<div class="chapt_hdr">Chapter X</div>
<div class="chapt_ttl">BEFORE AND AFTER.&mdash;THE ICE AGE.</div>


<p>We have read the story written in the rocks of the Isle of
Wight. What wonderful changes we have seen in the
course of the long history! First we were taken back to
the ancient Wealden river, and saw in imagination the
great continent through which it flowed, and the strange
creatures that lived in the old land. We saw the delta
sink beneath the sea, and a great thickness of shallow
water deposits laid down, enclosing remains of ammonites
and other beautiful forms of life. Then long ages passed
away, while in the waters of a deeper sea the great thickness
of the chalk was built up, mainly by the accumulation
of microscopic shells. In time the sea bed rose, and new
land appeared, and another river bore down fruits to be
buried with sea shells and remains of turtles and crocodiles
in the mud deposited near its mouth to form the
London clay. We followed the alternations of sea and
land, and the changing life of Eocene and Oligocene times.
We have heard of the early mammalia found in the quarries
of Quarr, and have learnt from the leaf beds of Alum Bay
that at that time the climate of this part of the world was
tropical. Indeed, I think everything goes to prove that
through the whole of the times we have been studying,&mdash;except
perhaps the earliest Eocene, that of the Reading
beds,&mdash;the climate was considerably warmer than it is
at the present day. After all these changes do you not
want to know what happened next? Well, at this point
we come to a gap in the records of the rocks, not only in
the Isle of Wight, but also in the British Isles. The
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_71" id="Page_71">[Pg&nbsp;71]</a></span>
British Isles, or even England and Wales alone, are almost,
if not quite unique in the world in that, in their small
extent, they contain specimens of nearly every formation
from the most ancient times to the present day. In
other parts of the world we may find regions many times
this area, where we can only study the rocks of some one
period. But just at this point in the story comes a period,&mdash;a
very important one, too,&mdash;the Miocene&mdash;of which we
have no remains in our Islands. We must hear a little
of what happened before we come back to the Isle of
Wight again in comparatively recent times.</p>

<p>But, first, perhaps, I had better tell,&mdash;just in outline,&mdash;something
of the earlier history of the world, before any
of our Isle of Wight rocks were made. For, if I do not,
quite a wrong idea may be formed of the world's history.
The time of the Wealden river has seemed to us very
ancient. We cannot say how many hundreds of
thousands, or rather millions of years have passed since
that ancient Wealden age. And you may have thought
that we had got back then very near the world's birthday,
and were looking at some of the oldest rocks on the
globe. But no. We are not near the beginning yet.
Compared with the vast ages that went before, our Wealden
period is almost modern. We cannot tell with any
certainty the comparative time; but we may compare
the thickness of strata formed to give us some sort of idea.
Now to the first strata in which fossil remains of living
things are found we have in all a thickness of strata some
12 times that of all the rocks we have been studying from
Wealden to Oligocene, together with the later rocks,
Miocene and Pliocene, not found in the Isle of Wight.
And before that there is, perhaps, an equal thickness of
sedimentary deposits; though the fossils they, no doubt,
once contained have been destroyed by changes the rocks
have undergone.</p>

<p>Now let me try to give you some idea of the world's
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_72" id="Page_72">[Pg&nbsp;72]</a></span>
history up to the point where we began in the Isle of
Wight. If we could see back through the ages to the
furthest past of geological history, we should see our
world,&mdash;before any of the stratified rocks were laid down
in the seas,&mdash;before the seas themselves were made,&mdash;a
hot globe, molten at least at the surface. How do we
know this? Because under the rocks of all the world's
surface we find there is granite or some similar rock,&mdash;a
rock which shows by its composition that it has crystallised
from a molten condition. Moreover we have seen
that the interior of the earth is intensely hot. And yet
all along the earth must be radiating off heat into the
cold depths of space, and cooling like any other hot body
surrounded by space cooler than itself. And this has
gone on for untold ages. Far enough back we must
come to a time when the earth was red hot,&mdash;white hot.
In imagination we see it cooling,&mdash;the molten mass solidifies
into Igneous rock,&mdash;the clouds of steam in which the
globe is wrapped condense in oceans upon the surface.
The bands of crystalline rock that rise above the primeval
seas are gradually worn down by rain and rivers and
waves, and the first sedimentary deposits laid down in
the waters. And in the waters and on the land life
appeared for the first time,&mdash;we know not how.</p>

<p>A vast thickness of stratified rocks was formed, which
are called Arch&aelig;an ("ancient"). They represent a time,
perhaps, as great as all that has followed. These rocks
have undergone great changes since their formation.
They have been pressed under masses of overlying
strata, and have come into the neighbourhood of the
heated interior of the earth; they have been burnt and
baked and compressed and folded, and acted on by heated
water and steam, and their whole structure altered by
heat and chemical action. Limestones, <i>e.g.</i>, have become
marble, with a crystalline structure which has obliterated
any fossils they may have once contained. Yet it is
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_73" id="Page_73">[Pg&nbsp;73]</a></span>
probable that, like nearly all later limestones, they are
of organic origin. These Arch&aelig;an rocks cover a large
extent of country in Canada. We have some of them in
our Islands, in the Hebrides, and north-west of Scotland
and in Anglesey, and rising from beneath later rocks in
the Malvern Hills and Charnwood Forest.<a name="FNanchor_A_12" id="FNanchor_A_12"></a><a href="#Footnote_A_12" class="fnanchor">[12]</a></p>

<p>The Arch&aelig;an rocks are succeeded by the most ancient
fossiliferous rocks, the great series called the Cambrian,
because found, and first studied, in Wales. They consist
of very hard rocks, and contain large quantities of slate.
They are followed by another series called the Ordovician;
and that by another the Silurian. These three great
systems of rocks measure in all some 30,000&nbsp;ft. of strata.
They form the hills of Wales and the English Lake
District. They contain large masses of volcanic rocks.
We can see where were the necks of old volcanoes, and
the sheets of lava which flowed from them. The volcanoes
are worn down to their bases now; and the hills of Wales
and the Lakes represent the remains of ancient mountain
chains, which rose high like the Alps in days of old, long
before Alps or Himalayas began to be made. These
ancient rocks contain abundant remains of living things,
chiefly mollusca, crustaceans, corals, and other marine
organisms, showing that the waters of those ages abounded
with life.</p>

<p>We must pass on. Next comes a period called the
Devonian, or Old Red Sandstone, when the Old Red rocks
of Devon and Scotland were laid down. These contain
remains of many varieties of very remarkable fish. A
long period of coral seas succeeded, when coral reefs
flourished over what was to be England; and their
remains formed the Carboniferous Limestone of Derbyshire
and the Mendip Hills. A period followed of
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_74" id="Page_74">[Pg&nbsp;74]</a></span>
immense duration, when over pretty well the whole earth
there seem to have been comparatively low lands covered
with a luxuriant and very strange vegetation. The
remains of these ancient forests have formed the coal
measures, which tell of the most widespread and longest
enduring growth of vegetation the world has seen.
Strange as some of the plants were&mdash;gigantic horsetails
and club-mosses growing into trees&mdash;many were exquisitely
beautiful. There were no flowering plants, but the
ferns, many of them tree ferns, were of as delicate beauty
as those of the present day. Many of the ferns bore seeds,
and were not reproduced by spores, such as we see on the
fronds of our present ferns. That is a wonderful story
of plant history, which has only been read in recent years.</p>

<p>After the long Carboniferous period came to an end
followed periods in which great formations of red sandstone
were made,&mdash;the Permian, and the New Red Sandstone
or Trias. During much of this time the condition
of the country seems to have resembled that of the
Steppes of Central Asia, or even the great desert of Sahara&mdash;great
dry sandy deserts&mdash;hills of bare rock with screes
of broken fragments heaped up at their base,&mdash;salt
inland lakes, depositing, as the effect of intense evaporation,
the beds of rock salt we find in Cheshire or elsewhere, in
the same manner as is taking place to-day in the Caspian
Sea, in the salt lakes of the northern edge of the Sahara,
and in the Great Salt Lake of Utah.</p>

<p>At the close of the period the land here sank beneath
the sea&mdash;again a sea of coral islands like the South Pacific
of to-day. There were many oscillations of level, or
changes of currents; and bands of clay, when mud from
the land was laid down, alternate with beds of limestone
formed in the clearer coral seas. These strata form a
period known as the Jurassic, from the large development
of the rocks in the Jura mountains. In England the
period includes the Liassic and Oolitic epochs. The
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_75" id="Page_75">[Pg&nbsp;75]</a></span>
Liassic strata stretch across England from Lyme Regis
in Dorset to Whitby in Yorkshire. Most of the strata
we are describing run across England from south-west to
north-east. After they were laid down a movement of
elevation, connected with the movement which raised
the Alps in Europe, took place along the lines of the
Welsh and Scotch mountains and the chain of Scandinavia,
which raised the various strata, and left them dipping to
the south-east. Worn down by denudation the edges
are now exposed in lines running south-west to north-east,
while the strata dip south-east under the edges of the
more recent strata. The Lias is noted for its ammonites,
and especially for its great marine reptiles, Ichthyosaurus
and Plesiosaurus. The Oolitic Epoch follows&mdash;a long
period during which the fine limestone, the Bath freestone,
was made; the limestones of the Cotswolds, beds of clay
known as the Oxford and Kimmeridge clays; and again
coral reefs left the rock known as coral rag. In the later
part of the period were formed the Portland and Purbeck
beds, marine and freshwater limestones, which contain
also an old land surface, which has left silicified trunks of
trees and stems of cycads.</p>

<p>And now following on these came our Wealden strata,
the beginning of the Cretaceous period. You see what
ages and ages had gone before, and that when Wealden
times came, far back as they are, the world's history was
comparatively approaching modern times. We must
remember that all these formations, of which we have
given a rapid sketch, are of great thickness,&mdash;thousands
of feet of rock,&mdash;and represent vast ages of time. See
what we have got to from looking at the shells in the sea
cliff! We have come to learn something of the world's
old history. We have been carried back through ages
that pass our imagination to the world's beginning, to the
time of the molten globe, before ever it was cool enough
to allow life&mdash;we know not how&mdash;to begin upon its
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_76" id="Page_76">[Pg&nbsp;76]</a></span>
surface. And Astronomy will take us back into an even
more distant past, and show us a nebulous mist of vast
extent stretching out into space like the nebul&aelig; observed
in the heavens to-day, before sun and planets and moons
were yet formed. So we are carried into the infinite of
time and space, and questions arise beyond the power
of human mind to solve.</p>

<p>Now we have, I hope, a better idea of the position the
strata we have been specially studying occupy in the
geological history, and shall understand the relation the
strata we may find elsewhere bear to those in the Isle
of Wight and the neighbouring south of England.</p>

<p>After this sketch of what went before our Island story,
we must see what followed at the end of the Oligocene
period. We said that there are no strata in the British
Isles representing the next period, the Miocene. But it was
a period of great importance in the world's history.
Great stratified deposits were laid down in France and
Switzerland and elsewhere, and it was a great age of
mountain building. The Alps and the Himalaya, largely
composed of Cretaceous and Eocene rocks, were upheaved
into great mountain ranges. It is probable that during
much of the period the British Isles were dry land, and
that great denudation of the land took place. But in the
first part of the period at all events this part of the world
must have been under water, and strata have been laid
down, which have since been denuded away. For our
soft Oligocene strata, if exposed to rain and river action
during the long Miocene period and the time which followed,
would surely have been entirely swept away. The
Miocene was succeeded by the Pliocene, when the strata
called the Crag, which cover the surface of Norfolk and
Suffolk, were formed. They are marine deposits with sea
shells, of which a considerable proportion of species still
survive.</p>

<p>We have seen that through the ages we have been
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_77" id="Page_77">[Pg&nbsp;77]</a></span>
studying the climate was mostly warmer than at the present
day. The climate of the Eocene was tropical. The
Miocene was sub-tropical and becoming cooler. Palms
become rarer in the Upper strata. Evergreens, which
form three-fourths of the flora in the Lower Miocene,
divide the flora with deciduous trees in the Upper. And
through the Pliocene the climate, though still warmer
than now, was steadily becoming cooler; till in the
beginning of the next period, the Pleistocene, it had
become considerably colder than that of the present day.
And then followed a time which is known as the great
Ice Age, or the Glacial Period,&mdash;a time which has left its
traces all over this country, and, indeed all over Northern
Europe and America, and even into southern lands. The
cold increased, heavy snowfalls piled up snow on the
mountains of Wales, the Lake District, and Scotland;
and the snow remained, and did not melt, and more fell
and pressed the lower snow into ice, which flowed down
the valleys in glaciers, as in Switzerland to-day. Gradually
all the vegetation of temperate lands disappeared, till
only the dwarf Arctic birch and Arctic willows were to be
seen. The sea shells of temperate climates were replaced
by northern species. Animals of warm and temperate
climates wandered south, and the Arctic fox, and the
Norwegian lemming, and the musk ox which now lives in
the far north of America took their place; and the
mammoth, an extinct elephant fitted by a thick coat of
hair and wool for living in cold countries, and a woolly-haired
rhinoceros, and other animals of arctic regions
occupied the land. When the cold was greatest, the
glaciers met and formed an ice-sheet; and Scotland,
northern England and the Midlands, Wales, and Ireland
were buried in one vast sheet of ice as Greenland is to-day.</p>

<p>How do we know this? To tell how the story has been
read would be to tell one of the most interesting stories
of geology. Here we can only give the briefest sketch of
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_78" id="Page_78">[Pg&nbsp;78]</a></span>
this wonderful chapter of the world's history. But we
must know a little of how the story has been made out.
We have already seen that the changes in plant and
animal life point to a change from a hot climate, through
a temperate, at last to arctic cold. Again, over the
greater part of Northern England the rocks of the various
geological periods are buried under sheets of tough clay,
called boulder clay, for it is studded with boulders large
and small, like raisins in a plum pudding. No flowing
water forms such a deposit, but it is found to be just like
the mass of clay with stones under the great glaciers and
ice sheets of arctic regions; and just such a boulder clay
may be seen extending from the lower end of glaciers in
Spitzbergen, when the glacier has temporarily retreated
in a succession of warm summers. The stones in our
boulder clay are polished and scratched in a way glaciers
are known to polish and scratch the stones they carry
along, and rub against the rocks and other stones. The
rock over which the glacier moves is similarly scratched
and polished, and just such scratching and polishing is
found on the rocks in Wales and the Lake District.
Again, we find rocks carried over hill and dale and right
across valleys, it may be half across England. We can
trace for great distances the lines of fragments of some
peculiar rock, as the granite of Shap in Westmorland; and
even rocks from Norway have been carried across the North
Sea, and left in East Anglia. This will just give an idea how
we know of this strange chapter in the history of our land.
For, by this time it was our land&mdash;England&mdash;much as we
know it to-day; though at times the whole stood higher
above sea level, so that the beds of the Channel and the
North Sea were dry land. But, apart from variation of
level, the geography was in the main as now.</p>

The ice sheet did not come further south than the
Thames valley. What was the country like south of
this? Well, you must think of the land just outside the
ice sheet in Greenland, or other arctic country. No
doubt the winters must have been very severe,&mdash;hard
frosts and heavy snows,&mdash;the ground frozen deep. Some
arctic animals would manage to live as they do now just
outside the ice sheet in Greenland. Now, have we any
deposits formed at that time in the Isle of Wight? I
think we have. A large part of the surface of the Island
is covered by sheets of flint gravel. The gravels differ
in age and mode of formation. We have already considered
the angular gravels of the Chalk downs, composed
of flints which have accumulated as the chalk which
once contained them was dissolved away. But there are
other gravel beds, which consist of flints which, after they
were set free by the dissolution of the chalk, have been
carried down to a lower level by rivers or other agency,
and more or less rounded in the process. Many of these
beds occur at a high level; and, as they usually cap flat-topped
hills, they are known as Plateau Gravels. Perhaps
the most remarkable is the immense sheet of gravel
which covers the flat top of St. George's Down between
Arreton and Newport. Gravel pits show upwards of
30 feet of gravel, consisting of flints with some chert and
ironstone, and the greatest thickness is probably considerably
more than this. The southern edge of the
sheet is cut off straight like a wall. To the north it runs
out on ridges between combes which have cut into it. In
places in the mass of flints occur beds of sand, which have
all the appearance of having been laid down by currents
of water. The base of the gravel where it is seen on the
steep southern slope of the down has been cemented by
water containing iron into a solid conglomerate rock.
The flints forming this gravel have not simply sunk down
from chalk strata dissolved away; for they lie on the
upturned edges of strata from Lower Greensand to Upper
Chalk, which have been planed off, and worn into a
surface sloping gently to the north; and over this surface
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_80" id="Page_80">[Pg&nbsp;80]</a></span>
the gravel has somehow flowed. The sharp wall in which
it ends at the upper part of the slope shows that it once
extended to the south over ground since worn away.
Clearly, the gravel was formed before denudation had cut
out the great gap between the central and southern downs
of the Island. The down where the gravel lies is 363&nbsp;ft.
above sea level, 313&nbsp;ft. above the bottom of the valley
below. So that, though the gravel sheet is much newer
than the strata we have been studying, it must nevertheless
be of great antiquity.</p>

<p>It seems that at the top of St. George's Down we are
standing on what was once the floor of an old valley. In
the course of denudation the bottom of a river valley
often becomes the highest part of a district. For the bed
of the valley is covered by flint gravel, and flint is excessively
hard, and the bed of flints protects the underlying
rock; so that, while the rocks on each side are worn
away, what was the river bed is eventually left high
above them. Thus the highest points of a district are
often capped by flint gravel marking the beds of old
streams. Tracing up this old valley to the southward,
at a few miles distance it will have reached the chalk
region on the south of the anticline: and the flints carried
down the valley may have come from beds of angular
flints already dissolved out of the chalk such as we find
on St. Boniface Down.</p>

<p>But how have these great masses of flints been swept
along? Can the land have been down under the sea;
and have sea waves washed the stones along? But these
flints, though water-worn, are not rounded as we find
beach shingle. What immense rush of water can have
spread these flints 30 feet deep along a river valley?
We must go to mountain regions for torrents of this
character. And then, mountain torrents round the stones
in their bed while these are mostly angular. The history
of these gravels is a difficult one. I can only give what
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_81" id="Page_81">[Pg&nbsp;81]</a></span>
seems to me the most probable explanation. It appears
to me probable that in the Ice Age, south of the ice sheet,
the ground must have been both broken up by frosts, and
also held together by being frozen hard to some depth.
Then when thaws came in the short but warm summers,
or when an intermission of the severe cold took place,
great floods would flow down the valleys in the country
south of the ice sheet, and masses of ice with frozen earth
and stones would be borne along in a sort of semi-liquid
flow. In this way Mr. Clement Reid explains the mass
of broken-up chalk with large stones found on the heads
of cliffs on the South coast, and known by the name of
"combe-rock" or "head."</p>

<p>The Ice Age was not one simple period, and it is still
difficult to fit together the history we read in different
places, and in particular to correlate the gravels of the
south of England with the boulder clays of the glaciated
area. There were certainly breaks in the period, during
which the climate became much milder, or even warm;
and these were long enough for southern species of
animals and plants to migrate northward, and occupy the
lands where an arctic climate had prevailed. There were
moreover considerable variations in the relative level of
land and sea. So that we have a very complex history,
which is gradually coming into clearer light.</p>

<p>That the gravels of the south of England belong largely
to the age of ice, is shown by remains of the mammoth
contained in many. These, however, are found in later
gravels than those we have considered so far, gravels laid
down after the land had been cut down to much lower
levels. These lower gravels are known as Valley gravels,
because they lie along the course of existing valleys, the
Plateau gravels having been laid down before the present
valleys came into existence. Teeth of the mammoth
are found in the Thames valley, and on the shores of
Southampton Water, in gravels about 50 to 70 feet above
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_82" id="Page_82">[Pg&nbsp;82]</a></span>
sea level, and have been found also in the Isle of Wight
at Freshwater Gate, at the top of the cliffs near Brook,
and in other places. The gravels near Brook with the
clays on which they rest have been contorted, and the
gravel forced into pockets in the clay, in a manner that
suggests the action of grounding ice ploughing into the soil.</p>

<p>The high level gravels must belong to an early stage of
the Glacial Epoch. We get some idea of the great length
of time this age must have lasted, as we look from St.
George's Down over the lower country of the centre of
the Island. After the formation of the St. George's Down
gravel the vast mass of strata between this and the opposite
downs of St. Boniface and St. Catherine's was removed by
denudation; and gravels were then laid down on the
lower land, along Blake Down, at Arreton, over Hale
common, and along the course of the Yar. Patches of
gravel occur on the Sandown and Shanklin cliffs. At
Little Stairs a gravel, largely of angular chert, reaches a
thickness of 12 feet, and in parts are several feet of loam
above gravel.</p>

<p>At the west of the Island a great sheet of gravel covers
the top of Headon Hill, reaching a height of 390 feet. It
appears sometimes to measure 30 feet in thickness. Like
that on St. George's Down it slopes towards the Solent,
resting on an eroded surface, in this case of Tertiary
strata; and here too the upper part of the sheet has been
removed by the wearing out of the deep valley between
the Hill and the Freshwater Downs. The sheet lies on
an old valley bottom, which sloped from the chalk downs
on the south, then much higher and more extensive than
now. Here too we may see something of the length of
the Glacial Period. For at Freshwater Gate is a much
later gravel, in which teeth of the mammoth have been
found. It was probably derived from older gravels that
once lay to the south, as the flints are rounded by transport.
But the formation of all these gravels appears to
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_83" id="Page_83">[Pg&nbsp;83]</a></span>
belong to the Glacial Period; and as we stand in Freshwater
Gate, and look at this great gap in the downs worn
out by the Western Yar, and think of the time when a
river valley passed over the tops of the High Downs and
Headon Hill, we receive a strong impression of the length
of the great Ice Age.</p>

<p>Now surely the question will be asked, what caused
these changes of climate in the world's past history&mdash;so
that at times a tropical vegetation spread over this land,
and vegetation flourished sufficient to leave beds of coal
within the Arctic circle, and in the Antarctic continent,
and at another the climate of Greenland came down to
England, and an ice sheet covered nearly the whole
country? This still remains one of the difficult problems
of Geology. An explanation has been attempted by
Astronomical Theory, according to which the varying
eccentricity of the earth's orbit&mdash;that is to say a slight
change in the elliptic orbit of the Earth, by which at times
it becomes less nearly circular&mdash;a change which is known
to take place&mdash;may have had the effect of producing these
variations of climatic conditions. The theory is very
alluring, for if this be the cause, we can calculate mathematically
the date and duration of the Glacial Period.
But, unfortunately, supposing the astronomical phenomena
to have the effect required, the course of events
given by the astronomical theory would be entirely different
to that revealed by geological research. Geographical
explanations have usually failed through being
of too local a character to explain a phenomenon which
affected the whole northern hemisphere, and the effects
of which reached at least as far south as the Equator,<a name="FNanchor_A_13" id="FNanchor_A_13"></a><a href="#Footnote_A_13" class="fnanchor">[13]</a>
and are seen again in the southern hemisphere in Australia,
New Zealand, and South America. It is now
believed that great world-movements take place, due to
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_84" id="Page_84">[Pg&nbsp;84]</a></span>
the contraction by cooling of the Earth's interior, and
the adjustment of the crust to the shrinkage.<a name="FNanchor_A_14" id="FNanchor_A_14"></a><a href="#Footnote_A_14" class="fnanchor">[14]</a> Possibly
some explanation might be found in these world-wide
movements; but their effect seems to last through too
long periods of time to suit our Ice Ages. Again, while
the geographical distribution of animals and plants in
the present and past seems to imply very great changes
in the land masses and oceanic areas,<a name="FNanchor_B_15" id="FNanchor_B_15"></a><a href="#Footnote_B_15" class="fnanchor">[15]</a> these changes
appear to bear no relation to glacial epochs. The cause
of the Ice Ages remains at present an unsolved problem.
More than one Ice Age has occurred during the long
geological history. The marks of such a period are found
in Arch&aelig;an rocks, in the Cambrian, when glaciers flowed
down to the sea level in China and South Australia within
a few degrees of the tropics, and above all in early Permian
times. The Dwyka conglomerate of the Karroo
formation of South Africa (deposits of Permo-Carboniferous
age) show evidence of extensive glaciation; deposits
of the same age in Northern and Central India,
even within the tropics, a glacial series of great thickness
in Australia, and deposits in Brazil, appear to show a
glaciation greater than that of the recent glacial period.
Yet these epochs formed only episodes in the great
geological eras. On the whole the climate throughout
geological time would seem to have been warmer than at
the present day. It may, perhaps, be doubted whether
the earth has yet recovered what we may call its <i>normal</i>
temperature since the Glacial Epoch.</p>

<p>Note on Astronomical Theory.&mdash;If the Ice Age be due
to the increased eccentricity of the Earth's orbit, the
theory shows that a long duration of normal temperature
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_85" id="Page_85">[Pg&nbsp;85]</a></span>
will be followed by a group of Glacial Periods alternating
between the northern and southern hemispheres, the time
elapsing between the culmination of such a period in one
hemisphere and in the other being about 10,500 years.
While one hemisphere is in a glacial period, the other will
be enjoying a specially mild,&mdash;a "genial" period. Now,
according to the record of the rocks, the "genial" periods
were far from being those breaks in the Glacial which we
know as Inter-glacial periods. We have the immensely
long warm period of the Eocene and Oligocene, the
Miocene with a still warm but reduced temperature, and
then the gradual cooling during the Pliocene, till the
drop in temperature culminates in the Ice Age. Moreover,
the duration of each glaciation during this Ice Age
is usually considered to have been much longer than the
10,000 years or so given by the Astronomical Theory.
Add to this that the periods of high eccentricity of the
Earth's orbit, though occurring at irregular intervals, are,
on the scale of geological time, pretty frequent; so that
several of such periods would have occurred during the
Eocene alone. Yet the geological evidence shows unbroken
sub-tropical conditions in this part of the world
throughout the Eocene.</p>

<div class="chapt_hdr">Chapter XI</div>
<div class="chapt_ttl">THE STORY OF THE ISLAND RIVERS; AND HOW
THE ISLE OF WIGHT BECAME AN ISLAND</div>

<p>We must now consider the history of the river system of
the Isle of Wight, to which our study of the gravels has
brought us. For rivers have a history, sometimes a most
interesting one, which carries us back far into the past.
Even the little rivers of the Isle of Wight may be truly
called ancient rivers. For though recent in comparison
with the ages of geological time, they are of a vast antiquity
compared with the historical periods of human
history.</p>

<p>To understand our river systems we must go back to
the time when strata formed by deposit of sediment in
the sea were upheaved above the sea level. To take the
simplest case, that of a single anticlinal axis fading off
gradually at each end, we shall have a sort of turtle back
of land emerged from the sea, as in <a href="#Fig_6">figure 6, <i>aa</i></a> being
the anticlinal axis. From this ridge streams will run
down on either side in the direction of the dip, their course
being determined by some minor folds of the strata, or
difference of hardness in the surface, or cracks formed
during elevation. On each side of the dip-streams smaller
ones will flow, more or less in the direction of the strike,
and run into the main streams. Various irregularities,
such as started the flow of the streams, will favour one or
another. Consider three streams, <i>a</i>, <i>b</i>, <i>c</i>, and let us suppose
the middle one the strongest, with greatest flow of
water, and cutting down its bed most rapidly. Its side
streams will become steeper and have more erosive force,
and so will eat back their courses most rapidly until they
strike the line of the streams on either side. Their steeper
channels will then offer the best way for the upper waters
of the streams they have cut to reach the sea; and these
streams will consequently be tapped, and their head
waters cut off to flow to the channel of the centre stream.
We shall thus have for a second stage in the history a
system such as is shown in <a href="#Fig_7">fig. 7</a>. The same process will
continue till one river has tapped several others; and
there will result the usual figure of a river and its
tributaries, to which we are accustomed on our maps.
We shall observe that tributaries do not as a rule gradually
approach the central stream, but suddenly turn off at
nearly a right angle from the direction in which they are
flowing, and, after a longer or shorter course, join at
another sharp angle a river flowing more or less parallel
to their original direction.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_125" id="Page_125">[Pg&nbsp;125]</a></span>
The Chalk and overlying Tertiary strata were uplifted
from the sea in great folds forming a series of such turtle-backs
as we have been considering. The line of upheaval
was not south-west and north-east, as that which raised
the older formations in bands across England, but took
place in an east and west direction. The main upheaval
was that of the great Wealden anticline. Other folds
produced the Sandown and Brook anticlines, and that
of the Portsdown Hills. The upheaval seemed to have
been caused by pressure acting from the south, for the
steeper slope of each fold is on the northern side. Our
latest Oligocene strata are tilted with the chalk, showing
that the upheaval took place after Oligocene times. But
the great movement was in the main earlier than the
Pliocene. For on the North Downs near Lenham is a
patch of Lower Pliocene deposit resting directly on the
Chalk, the older Tertiary strata having been removed by
denudation, clearly due to the uplift of the Wealden
anticline. The raising of the Pliocene deposit to its
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_88" id="Page_88">[Pg&nbsp;88]</a></span>
present position proves that the same movement was continued
at a later time, probably during the Pleistocene.
But the greater part of the movement may be assigned to
the Miocene, the period of great world-movements which
raised the Alps and the Himalaya.</p>

<p>Many remarkable, and, at first sight, very puzzling
features connected with the courses of rivers find an
explanation when we study the river history. Thus,
looking at the Weald of Kent and Sussex, we see that it
consists of comparatively low ground rising to a line of
heights east and west along the centre, and surrounded
on all sides but the south-east by a wall of Chalk downs.
If we considered the subject, we should suppose that the
drainage of the country would be towards the south-east,
which is open to the sea. Not so. All the rivers flow from
the central heights north and south,&mdash;go straight for the
walls of chalk downs, and cut through the escarpment in
deep clefts to flow into the Thames and the Channel.
This is explained when we remember that the rivers began
to flow when the great curve of strata rose above the sea.
Though eroded by the sea during its elevation, yet when
it rose above the waters the arch of chalk must have been
continuous from what are now North Downs to South.
And from the centre line of the great turtle back the
streams began to flow north and south, cutting in the
course of ages deep channels for themselves. The greater
erosion in their higher courses has cut away the mass of
chalk from the centre of the Weald, but the rivers still
flow in the direction determined when the arch was still
entire.</p>

<p>We have a similar state of things in the Isle of Wight.
Any one not knowing the geological story, and looking at
the geography of the Island, might naturally suppose
that there would be a stream flowing from west to east,
through the low ground between the two ranges of downs,
and finding its way into the sea in Sandown Bay. Instead
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_89" id="Page_89">[Pg&nbsp;89]</a></span>
of this the three rivers of the Island, the two Yars and the
Medina, all flow north, and cut through the chalk escarpment
of the Central downs, as if an earthquake had made
rifts for them to pass, and so find their way into the
Solent. The explanation is the same as in the case of the
Weald. The rivers began to flow when the Chalk strata
were continuous over the centre of the Island; and their
course was determined when the east and west anticlinal
axis rose above the sea.</p>

<p>We shall notice, however, that the Island rivers start
from south of the anticlinal axis. The centre of the
Sandown anticline runs just north of Sandown, but the
various branches of the Yar and Medina flow from well
south of this. The explanation would appear to be that
the anticline is almost a monoclinal curve,&mdash;that is to say,
one slope is steep, the other not far from horizontal.
Streams starting from the ridge would flow with much
greater force down the northern than the southern side,
and would cut back their course much more quickly.
Thus they would continually cut into the heads of the
southern streams, and turn the water supplying them
into their own channels.</p>

<p>In its early history a river cuts out its bed, and carries
along pebbles, sand and mud to the sea. The head waters
are constantly cutting back, and the slope becoming less
steep, till a time comes when the stream in its gently
inclined lower course has no more power to excavate,
and the finer sediment, which is all that now reaches the
lower river, begins to fill up the old channel. And so the
alluvium is formed which fills the lower portions of our
river valleys.</p>

<p>Beyond this, the great rush of waters from melting
snows and ice of the Glacial Period has come to an end.
The gentler and diminished streams of a drier age have
no power to roll flint stones along and form beds of gravel.
Gravel terraces border our river valleys at a higher
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_90" id="Page_90">[Pg&nbsp;90]</a></span>
level than the present streams. Periods alternated during
which gravels were laid down by the river, and when the
river acquiring more erosive force, by an elevation of the
land giving its bed a steeper gradient, or a wetter climate
producing a greater rush of water, cut a new channel
deeper in the old valley. So our valleys in Southern
England are frequently bordered by a succession of gravel
terraces, the higher ones being the older, dating from times
when the river flowed at a higher level than at present.
Such terraces may be seen above the Eastern Yar and its
tributary streams. In the centre of the old gravels is the
alluvial flat of a later age.</p>

<p>The Island rivers cut out their channels when the land
stood at a higher level than at present. The old channels
of the lower parts of the rivers are now filled with alluvium,
partly brought down by the rivers and partly marine.
The channels are cut down considerably below sea level;
and by the sinking of the land the sea has flowed in, and
the last parts of the river courses are now tidal estuaries.
The sea does not cut out estuaries. They are the submerged
ends of river valleys.</p>

<p>Some idea may be formed of the antiquity of our Island
rivers by observing the depth of the clefts they have cut
through the downs at Brading, Newport, and Freshwater.
But to this we must add the depth at which the old
channels lie below the alluvium. It would be interesting
to know the thickness of the alluvium. But it is not often
that borings come to be made in river alluvia. However,
in the old Spithead forts artesian wells are sunk; and
these pass through 70 to 90 feet of recent deposits before
entering Eocene strata. Under St. Helen's Fort, at the
mouth of Brading Harbour, are 80 feet of recent deposits.
The old channel of the Yar, at its mouth, must lie at least
at this depth.</p>

<p>Before it passes through the gap in the Chalk downs
the Yar has meandered about, and formed the alluvial
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_91" id="Page_91">[Pg&nbsp;91]</a></span>
flat called Morton marshes. These marshes stretch out
into the flat known as Sandown Level, which occupies the
shore of the bay between Sandown and the Granite Fort.
What is the meaning of this extension of the alluvium
away from the course of the river out to the sea at Sandown?
A glance at it as pictured on a geological map
will suggest the answer. We see clearly the alluvia of
two streams converging from right and left, and uniting
to pass to the sea through Brading Harbour. But the
stream to the right has been cut off by the sea encroaching
on Sandown Bay: only the last mile of alluvium is left
to tell of a river passed away. We must reconstruct the
past. We see the Bay covered by land sloping up to east
and south east, the lines of downs extending eastward
from Dunnose and the Culvers, and an old river flowing
northward, and cutting through the chalk at Brading
after being joined by a branch from the west. This old
river must have been the main stream. For it was a
transverse stream, flowing nearly at right angles to the
ridge of the anticline; while the Yar comes in as a tributary
in the direction of the strike. Of other tributary
streams, all from the right are gone by the destruction of
the old land. On the left streams would flow in from the
combes at Shanklin and Luccombe&mdash;streams which have
now cut out Shanklin and Luccombe chines.</p>

<p>Passing the gap in the downs the river meandered about,
and, with marine deposit, washed in by the tides, formed
the expanse of alluvium which occupies what was Brading
Harbour,&mdash;a harbour which in old times presented at high
tide a beautiful spectacle of land-locked water extending
up to Brading. Inclosures and drainings have been made
from time to time, the upper part near Yarbridge being
taken in in the time of Edward I. Further innings were
made in the reign of Queen Elizabeth; and Sir Hugh
Middleton, who brought the New River to London,
made an attempt to enclose the whole, but the sea broke
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_92" id="Page_92">[Pg&nbsp;92]</a></span>
through his embankment. The harbour was finally
reclaimed at great cost in 1880, the present embankment
enclosing an area of 600 acres.</p>

<p>The history of the Western Yar is similar to that of the
Eastern. The main stream must have flowed from land
now destroyed by the sea stretching far south of Freshwater
Gate. All that is left is its tidal estuary, and the
gravel terraces and alluvial flat formed in the last part of
its course. Of a tributary stream an interesting relic
remains. For more than 2 miles from Chilton Chine
through Brook to Compton Grange a bed of river gravel
lies at the top of the cliff, marking the course of an old
stream, of which coast erosion has made a longitudinal
section. This was a tributary of the Yar, when the
mammoth left his remains in the gravel at Grange Chine
and Freshwater Gate. Down the centre of the gravels
lies a strip of alluvium laid down by a stream following
the same course in later days. The sea had probably by
this time cut into the stream; and it most likely flowed
into the sea somewhere west of Brook. In the alluvium
hazel nuts and twigs of trees are found at Shippard's
Chine near Brook.</p>

<p>The lower course of the Medina is a submerged river
valley, the tide flowing up to Newport. The river rises
near Chale, and flows through a strip of alluvium, overgrown
with marsh vegetation, known as "The Wilderness."
This upper course of the Medina, from the absence
of gravels or brick earth, has the appearance of a comparatively
modern river. But the Medina has a further
history. If you look at the map you will see branches
of the Yar running south to north as transverse streams,
but the main course is that of a lateral river. Look at
the two chief sources of the Yar&mdash;the stream from near
Whitwell and Niton, and that from the Wroxall valley.
When they get down to the marshes near Rookley and
Merston, they are not flowing at all in the direction of
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_93" id="Page_93">[Pg&nbsp;93]</a></span>
Sandown or Brading. They rather look as if they would
flow along the marshy flat by Blackwater into the Medina.
But the Yar cuts right across their course, and carries
them off eastward to Sandown. When we look, we find
a line of river valley with a strip of alluvium running up
from the Medina at Blackwater in the direction of these
two streams&mdash;a valley which the railway up the Yar
valley from Sandown makes use of to get to Newport.
There can be little doubt that these streams from Niton
and Wroxall originally ran along this line into the
Medina; but the Yar, cutting its course backward, has
captured them, and diverted their course. They probably
represent the main branches of the Medina in earlier
times, the direction of flow from south-east to north-west
instead of south to north being possibly due to the overlapping
in the neighbourhood of Newport of the ends of
the Brook and Sandown anticlines. The sheet of gravel
on Blake Down belongs to this period of the river's history.
The river must have diverted between the deposition of
the Plateau Gravels and that of the Valley Gravels of the
Yar. For the former follow the original valley, the
latter the new course of the river.</p>

<p>We must now take a wider outlook, and see what became
of our rivers after they had flowed across what is now the
Isle of Wight from south to north. We have been speaking
of times when the Island was of much greater extent
than at present. Standing on the down above the Needles,
and looking westward, we see on a clear day the Isle of
Purbeck lying opposite, and we can see that the headland
there is formed by white chalk cliffs like those beneath us.
In front of them stand the Old Harry Rocks, answering to
the Needles, both relics of a former extension of the land.
In fact Purbeck is just like a continuation of the Isle of
Wight. South of the Chalk lie Greensand and Wealden
strata in Swanage Bay, and north towards Poole are
Tertiaries. Clearly these strata were once continuous
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_94" id="Page_94">[Pg&nbsp;94]</a></span>
with those of the Isle of Wight. We must imagine
the chalk downs of the Island continued as a long range
across what is now sea, and on through Purbeck. A great
Valley must have stretched from west to east, north of
this line, along the course of the Frome, which runs
through Dorset, and now enters the sea at Poole Harbour,
on by Bournemouth, and along the present Solent Channel&mdash;a
valley still much above sea level, not yet cut down by
rivers and the sea&mdash;and down the centre of this valley a
river must have flowed, which may be called the River
Solent. It received as tributaries from the south the
rivers of the Isle of Wight, and others from land since
destroyed by the sea. There flowed into it from the
north the waters of the Stour and Avon, and an old river
which flowed down the line of what is now Southampton
Water. Southampton Water looks like the valley of a
large river, much larger than the present Test and Itchen.
Its direction points to a river from the north west; and
it has been shown by Mr. Clement Reid that the Salisbury
rivers&mdash;Avon, Nadder, and Wily&mdash;at a former time, when
they flowed far above their present level&mdash;continued their
course into the valley of Southampton Water. For fragments
of Purbeck rocks from the Vale of Wardour, west
of Salisbury, have been found by him in gravels on high
land near Bramshaw, carried right over the deep vale of
the Avon in the direction of the Water. The lower Avon
would originally be a tributary of the Solent River; and
it enters the sea about mid-way between the Needles
and the chalk cliffs of Purbeck, just opposite the point
where we might suppose the sea would have first broken
through the line of chalk downs. No doubt it broke
through a gap made by the course of an old river from the
south, as it is now breaking through the gap made by the
old Yar at Freshwater. When the river Solent had been
tapped at this point, the Avon just opposite would have
acquired a much steeper flow, causing it to cut back at a
faster rate, till it cut the course of the old river which ran
by Salisbury to Southampton, and, having a steeper fall,
diverted the upper waters of this river into its own
channel.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_95" id="Page_95">[Pg&nbsp;95]</a></span>
Frost and rain and rivers cut down the valleys of the
river system for hundreds of feet; the sea which had
broken through the chalk range gradually cut away the
south side of the main river valley from Purbeck to the
Needles; and eventually the valley itself was submerged
by a subsidence of the land, and the sea flowed between
the Isle of Wight and the mainland.</p>

<p>A gravel of somewhat different character to the rest is
the sheet of flint shingle at Bembridge Foreland. It
forms a cliff of gravel about 25 feet high resting on
Bembridge marls, and consists of large flints, with lines of
smaller flints and sand showing current bedding, and also
contains Greensand chert and sandstone, which must
have been brought from some district beyond the Chalk.
The shingle slopes to north-east. To the south-west it
ends abruptly, the dividing line between shingle and marls
running up steeply into the cliff. This evidently marks
an old sea cliff in the marls, against which the gravel has
been laid down.<a name="FNanchor_A_16" id="FNanchor_A_16"></a><a href="#Footnote_A_16" class="fnanchor">[16]</a></p>

<p>One or two comparatively recent deposits may be
mentioned here. At the top of the cliff in Totland Bay,
about 60&nbsp;ft. above the sea, for a distance of 350 yards, is a
lacustrine deposit, consisting in the main of a calcareous
tufa deposited by springs flowing from the limestone of
Headon Hill. The tufa contains black lines from vegetable
matter, and numerous land and freshwater shells
of present-day species&mdash;many species of Helix, especially
<i>H. nemoralis</i> and <i>H. rotundata</i>, <i>Cyclostoma elegans</i>, <i>Limn&aelig;a
palustris</i>, <i>Pupa</i>, <i>Clausilia</i>, <i>Cyclas</i>, and others.</p>

<p>On the top of Gore Cliff is a deposit of hard calcareous
mud, reaching a thickness of about 9 feet, and forming a
small vertical cliff above the slopes of chalk marl. It
extends north a few yards beyond the chalk marl on to
Lower Greensand. It has been formed by rainwash from
a hill of chalk, which must once have existed to the south.
The deposit contains numerous existing land-shells,
especially <i>Helix nemoralis</i> and other species of Helix.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_96" id="Page_96">[Pg&nbsp;96]</a></span>
Between Atherfield and Chale at the top of the cliff is
a large area of Blown Sand. The sand is blown up from
the face of the cliff below. It reaches a thickness of 20
feet, and possibly more in places, and forms a line of
sand dunes along the edge of the cliff. The upper part of
Ladder Chine shows an interesting example of wind-erosion.
The sand driven round it by the wind has worn
it into a semi-circular hollow like a Roman theatre.</p>

<p>Small spits, consisting partly of blown sand, extend
opposite the mouths of the Western Yar, the Newtown
river, and the most extensive&mdash;at the mouth of the old
Brading Harbour, separating the present reduced Bembridge
Harbour from the sea. This is called St. Helen's
Spit, or "Dover,"&mdash;the local name for these sand spits.</p>

<div class="chapt_hdr">Chapter XII</div>
<div class="chapt_ttl">THE COMING OF MAN.</div>

<p>We have watched the long succession of varied life on the
earth recorded in the rocks, and now we come to the most
momentous event of all in the history&mdash;the coming of Man.
The first certain evidence of the presence of man on the
earth is found with the coming of the Glacial Period,&mdash;unless
indeed the supposed flint implements found by
Mr. Reid Moir, under the Crag in Suffolk, should prove him
earlier still. It is a rare chance that the skeleton of a land
animal is preserved; especially rare in the case of a skeleton
so frail as that of man. The best chance for the preservation
of bones is in deposits in caves, which were frequently
the dens of wild beasts and the shelters of man. But the
implements used by early man were happily of a very
imperishable nature. His favourite material, if he could
get it, was flint. Flint could by dexterous blows have
flake after flake taken off, till it formed a tool or weapon
with sharp point and cutting edge. The implements,
though only chipped, or flaked, were often admirably
made. They have very characteristic shapes. Moreover,
the kind of blow&mdash;struck obliquely&mdash;by which these early
men made their tools left marks which stamp them as of
human workmanship. The flake struck off shows what is
called a "bulb of percussion"&mdash;a swelling which marks
the spot where the blow was struck&mdash;and from this
extends a series of ripples, producing a surface like that of a
shell, from which this mode of breaking is called conchoidal
fracture. Often, by further chipping the flake itself is
worked into an implement. Implements have also been
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_98" id="Page_98">[Pg&nbsp;98]</a></span>
made of chert, but it is far more difficult to work, as it
naturally breaks in an irregular way into sharp angular
fragments. Flint, on the other hand, lent itself admirably
to the use of early man, who in time acquired a perfect
mastery of the material. The working of flints is so
characteristic that, once accustomed to them, you cannot
mistake a good specimen. Sea waves dashing pebbles
about will sometimes produce a conchoidal fracture, but
never a series of fractures in the methodical way in which
a flint was worked by man. And, of course, specimens
may be found so worn that it is difficult to be sure about
their nature. Again early man may, especially in very
early times, have been content to use a sharp stone almost
as he found it, with only the slightest amount of knocking
it into shape. So that in such a case it will be very
difficult to decide whether the stones have formed the
implements of man or not. In later times men learnt to
polish their implements, and made polished stone axes
like those the New Zealanders and South Sea Islanders
used to make in modern times. The old age of chipped or
flaked implements is called the Pal&aelig;olithic; the later age
when they were ground or polished the Neolithic. (Simple
implements, as knives and scrapers, were still unpolished.)
The history of early man is a long story in itself, and of
intense interest. But we must not leave our geological
story unfinished by leaving out the culmination of it all
in man. In the higher gravels&mdash;the Plateau Gravels&mdash;no
remains of man are found; but in the lower&mdash;the
Valley Gravels,&mdash;of the South of England is found abundant
evidence of the presence of man. Large numbers of
flint implements have been collected from the Thames valley
and over the whole area of the rivers which have gravel
terraces along their course. Over a large sheet of gravel
at Southampton, whenever a large gravel pit is dug, implements
are found at the base of the gravel.<a name="FNanchor_A_17" id="FNanchor_A_17"></a><a href="#Footnote_A_17" class="fnanchor">[17]</a> The
occurrence of the mammoth and other arctic creatures in
the gravels shows that in the Glacial Period man was
contemporary with these animals. Remains in caves
tell the same story. In limestone caverns in Devon,
Derbyshire, and Yorkshire, implements made by man are
found in company with remains of the cave bear, cave
hy&aelig;na, lion, hippopotamus, rhinoceros, and other animals
either extinct or no longer inhabitants of this country&mdash;remains
which have been preserved under floors of stalagmite
deposited in the caves. In caves of central France
men have left carvings on bone and ivory, representing the
wild animals of that day&mdash;carvings which show a remarkable
artistic sense, and a keen observation of animal life.
Among them is a drawing of the mammoth on a piece of
mammoth ivory, showing admirably the appearance of
the animal, with his long hair, as he has been found
preserved in ice to the present day near the mouths of
Siberian rivers. Drawings of the reindeer, true to life,
are frequent.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_99" id="Page_99">[Pg&nbsp;99]</a></span>
Till recently very few Pal&aelig;olithic implements had been
recorded as found in the Isle of Wight. In the Memoir
of the Geological Survey (1889) only one such is recorded,
found in a patch of brick earth near Howgate Farm,
Bembridge.<a name="FNanchor_A_18" id="FNanchor_A_18"></a><a href="#Footnote_A_18" class="fnanchor">[18]</a> A few more implements, which almost
certainly came from this brick-earth, have been found on
the shore since. In recent years a large number of Pal&aelig;olithic
implements have been found at Priory Bay near
St. Helen's. They were first observed on the beach by
Prof. E. B. Poulton, F.R.S., in 1886, and were traced to
their source in the gravel in the cliff by Miss Moseley in
1902. From that time, and especially from 1904 onwards,
many have been found by Prof. Poulton, by R. W. Poulton
(and others). Up to 1909 about 150 implements had been
found, and there have been more finds since.<a name="FNanchor_B_19" id="FNanchor_B_19"></a><a href="#Footnote_B_19" class="fnanchor">[19]</a></p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_100" id="Page_100">[Pg&nbsp;100]</a></span>
The most important finds, besides those at Priory Bay,
have been those of Mr. S. Hazzledine Warren at Freshwater,
especially in trial borings in loam and clay below
the surface soil in a depression of the High Downs, south
of Headon Hill, at a level of about 360&nbsp;ft. O.D., in which
a number of Pal&aelig;olithic tools, flakes, and cores were
found<a name="FNanchor_A_20" id="FNanchor_A_20"></a><a href="#Footnote_A_20" class="fnanchor">[20]</a>. Isolated implements have been found in
recent years in various localities in the Island. There are
references to finds of implements at different times in the
past, but the descriptions are generally too vague to
conclude certainly to what date they belong. Much of
the gravel used in the Island comes from the angular
gravel on St. Boniface Down, or the high Plateau Gravel of
St. George's Down; but in the lower gravels and associated
brick earth, it is highly probable that more remains of
Pal&aelig;olithic man will yet be found in the Island, and
quite possible that such have been found in the past, but
for want of accurate descriptions of the circumstances of
the finds are lost to us.</p>

<p>We must pass on to the men of the Neolithic or later
stone age. The Pal&aelig;olithic age was of very great duration,
much longer than all succeeding human history. Between
Pal&aelig;olithic and Neolithic times there is in England a large
gap. In France various stages have been traced showing
a continual advance in culture. In England little, if anything,
has been found belonging to the intermediate stages.
Such remains may yet be found in caves, or in lower river
gravels, now buried below the alluvium. The gap between
Pal&aelig;olithic and Neolithic is marked by the great amount
of river erosion which took place in the interval.
Pal&aelig;olithic implements are found in gravels formed when
the rivers flowed some 100 feet above their present courses.
Take, <i>e.g.</i>, the Itchen at Southampton. After the 100 foot
gravels were deposited the river cut down, not merely to
its present level, but to an old bed now covered up by
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_101" id="Page_101">[Pg&nbsp;101]</a></span>
various deposits beneath the river. After cutting down to
that bed the river laid down gravels upon it; and then&mdash;the
land standing at a higher level than to-day&mdash;the river
valley and the <a name="surrounding1"></a><a href="#typos">surrounding</a> country were covered by a
forest, which, as the climate altered and became damper,
was succeeded by the formation of peat. The land has
since sunk, and the peat, in parts 17&nbsp;ft. thick, is now found
under Southampton Water, covered by estuarine silt.
The Empress Dock at Southampton was dug where a mud
bank was exposed at low water. The mud bank was
formed of river silt 12 to 17 feet thick. Below this was the
peat, resting on gravel. On the gravel horns of reindeer
were found. In the peat were large horn cores of the great
extinct ox, <i>Bos primigenius</i>, also horns of red deer, and
also in the peat were found neolithic flint chips, a circular
stone hammer head, with a hole bored through for a
wooden handle, and a large needle made of horn. Here,
at a great interval of time after Pal&aelig;olithic man, as we see
by the history of the river we have just traced, we come
to the new race of men, the Neolithic.</p>

<p>When Neolithic man appeared the land stood higher than
at present, though not so high as during great part of the
Pleistocene. Britain was divided from the Continent,
but the shores were a good way out into what is now sea
round the coasts, and forests clothed these further shores.
Remains of these, known as submerged forest, are found
below the tide mark round many parts of our coast. Peat
as at Southampton Docks, is found under the estuarine
mud off Netley. The wells at the Spithead Forts show an
old land surface with peat more than 50 feet below the
tide level. The old bed of the Solent river lies much lower
still&mdash;124 feet below high tide at Noman's Land Fort;
this channel was probably an estuary after the subsidence
of the land till it silted up with marine deposits to the
level on which the submerged forest grew.</p>

<p>When the Solent and Southampton Water were wooded
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_102" id="Page_102">[Pg&nbsp;102]</a></span>
valleys with rivers flowing down the middle, the Isle of
Wight rivers were tributaries to the Solent river, and the
forest, as might be expected, extended up their valleys,
and covered the low ground of the Island. Under the
alluvial flats are remains of buried forests. In digging a
well at Sandford in 1906 large trunks of hard oak were
found blocking the sinking of the well. When the land
sank the sea flowed up the river valleys, converting them
into strait and estuary, and largely filling up the channels
with the silt, which now covers the peat. In the silt of
Newtown river are found bones of <i>Bos primigenius</i>,
which was found with the Neolithic remains <a name="in"></a><a href="#typos">in</a> the peat
of Southampton docks.</p>

<p>The remains of Neolithic man are not only found in
submerged forests, but over the present surface of the
land, or buried in recent deposits. He has left us the
tombs of his chiefs, known as long barrows&mdash;great mounds
of earth covering a row of chambers made of flat
stones, such as the mounds of New Grange in Ireland, and
the cromlechs or dolmens still standing in Wales and
Cornwall. These consist of a large flat or curved stone&mdash;it
may be 14 feet in length,&mdash;supported on three or four
others. Originally a great mound of earth or stones was
piled on top. These have generally been removed since
by the hand of later man. The stones have been taken
for road metal, the earth to lay on the land. The great
cromlech at Lanyon in Cornwall was uncovered by a
farmer, who had removed 100 cart loads of earth to lay
on his stony land before he had any idea that it was not
a natural mound. Then he came on the great cromlech
underneath. Another form of monument was the great
standing stone or menhir, one of which, the Longstone on
the Down above Mottistone still stands to mark the tomb
of some chieftain of, it may be, 4,000 years ago.</p>

<p>The implements of Neolithic man are found all over
England, the smooth polished axe head, commonly called
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_103" id="Page_103">[Pg&nbsp;103]</a></span>
a celt (Lat. <i>celtis</i>, a chisel), the chipped arrow head, the
flaked flint worked by secondary chipping on the edge
into a knife, or a scraper for skins; and much more common
than the implement, even of the simplest description, are
the waste flakes struck off in the making. Very few stone
celts have been found in the Isle of Wight. The flakes are
extremely numerous, and a scraper or knife may often be
found. They are turned up by the plough on the surface
of the fields, in the earth of which they have been preserved
from rubbing and weathering. They have however, acquired
a remarkable polish, or "patina"&mdash;how is not clearly
explained&mdash;which distinguishes their surface from the
waxy appearance of newly-broken flint. In places the
ground is so covered with flakes that we can have no doubt
that these are the sites of settlements. The implements
were made from the black flints fresh out of the chalk,
and we can locate the Neolithic flint workings. In our
northern range of downs where the strata are vertical the
layers of flint in the Upper Chalk run out on the top of
the downs, only covered with a thin surface soil. In places
where this soil has been removed&mdash;as in digging a quarry&mdash;the
chalk is seen to be covered with flakes similar to those
found on the lower ground, save that they are weathered
white from lying exposed on the hard chalk, instead of on
soft soil into which they would gradually sink by the
burrowing of worms. It is probable that these flakes
would be found more or less along the range of downs
under the surface soil.</p>

<p>In places on the Undercliff have been found what are
known as Kitchen Middens&mdash;heaps of shells which have
accumulated near the huts of tribes of coast dwellers, who
lived on shellfish. One such was formerly exposed in the
stream below the old church at Bonchurch, and is believed
to extend below the foundations of the Church.</p>

<p>After a long duration of neolithic times a great step in
civilisation took place with the introduction of bronze.
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_104" id="Page_104">[Pg&nbsp;104]</a></span>
Bronze implements were introduced into this country
probably some time about B.C. 1800-1500; and bronze
continued to be the best material of manufacture till the
introduction of iron some two or three centuries before the
visit of Julius Caesar to these Islands. To the early bronze
age belong the graves of ancient chieftains known as
round barrows, of which many are to be seen on the Island
downs. Funeral urns and other remains have been found
in these, some of which are now in the museum at Carisbrooke
Castle. Belonging to later times are the remains
of the Roman villa at Brading and smaller remains of
villas in other places; and cemeteries of Anglo-Saxon
date, rich in weapons and ornaments, which have been
excavated on Chessil and Bowcombe Downs. But the
study of the remains of ancient man forms a science in
itself&mdash;Arch&aelig;ology. In studying the periods of Pal&aelig;olithic
and Neolithic man we have stood on the borderland
where Geology and Arch&aelig;ology meet. We have seen that
vast geological changes have taken place since man appeared
on earth. We must remember that the geological
record is still in process of being written. It is not the
record of a time sundered from the present day, but continuous
with our own times; and it is by the study of
processes still in operation that we are able to read the
story of the past.</p>

<div class="chapt_hdr">Chapter XIII.</div>
<div class="chapt_ttl">THE SCENERY OF THE ISLAND&mdash;<span class="smcap">Conclusion</span>.</div>

<p>After studying the various geological formations that enter
into the composition of the Isle of Wight, and learning
how the Island was made, it will be interesting to take
a general view of the scenery, and see how its varied
character is due to the nature of its geology. It would
hardly be possible to find anywhere an area so small as
this little Island with such a variety of geological formations.
The result is a remarkable variety in the scenery.</p>

<p>The main feature of the Island is the range of chalk
downs running east and west, and terminating in the bold
cliffs of white chalk at Freshwater and the Culvers. Here
we have vertical cliffs of great height, their white softened
to grey by weathering and the soft haze through which
they are often seen. In striking contrast of colour are the
Red Cliff of Lower Greensand adjoining the Culvers, and
the many-coloured sands of Alum Bay joining on to the
chalk of Freshwater. The summits of the chalk downs
have a characteristic softly rounded form, and the chalk
is covered with close short herbage suited to the sheep
which frequently dot the green surface. Where sheets of
flint gravel cap the downs, as on St. Boniface, they are
covered by furze and heather, producing a charming
variation from the smooth turf where the surface is chalk.
The Lower Greensand forms most of the undulating
country between the two ranges of downs; while the
Upper Greensand, though occupying a smaller area, produces
one of the most conspicuous features of the scenery&mdash;the
walls of escarpment that form the inland cliffs between
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_106" id="Page_106">[Pg&nbsp;106]</a></span>
Shanklin and Wroxall, Gat Cliff above Appuldurcombe, the
fine wall of Gore Cliff above Rocken End, and the line of
cliffs above the Undercliff. To the Gault Clay is due the
formation of the Undercliff&mdash;the terrace of tumbled strata
running for miles well above the sea, but sheltered by an
upper cliff on the north, and in parts overgrown with
picturesque woods. The impervious Gault clay throws
out springs around the downs, which form the headwaters
of the various Island streams. The upper division of the
Lower Greensand, the Sandrock, forms picturesque undulating
foothills, often wooded, as at Apsecastle, and at
Appuldurcombe and Godshill Park. On a spur of the
Sandrock stands Godshill Church, a landmark visible
for miles around. At Atherfield we have a fine line of
cliffs of Lower Greensand, while the Wealden Strata on to
Brook form lower and softer cliffs.</p>

<p>To the north of the central downs the Tertiary sands
and clays, often covered by Plateau gravel, form an
extended slope towards the Solent shore, much of it well
wooded, and presenting a charming landscape seen from
the tops of the downs. This slope of Tertiary strata is
deeply cut into by streams, which form ravines and
picturesque creeks, as Wootton Creek, 200 feet below the
level of the <a name="surrounding2"></a><a href="#typos">surrounding</a> country. While much of the
Island coast is a line of vertical cliff, the northern shores
are of gentler aspect, wooded slopes reaching to the
water's edge, or meadow land sloping gradually to the
sea level. Opposite the mouths of streams are banks of
shingle and sand dunes, forming the spits locally known as
"dovers." Some of these, in particular, St. Helen's Spit,
afford interesting hunting grounds for the botanist.</p>

<p>The great variety of soil and situation renders the Isle
of Wight a place of interest to the botanist. We have
the plants of chalk downs, of the sea cliff and shore, of the
woods and meadows, of lane and hedgerow, and of the
marshes. The old villages of the Island, often occupying
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_107" id="Page_107">[Pg&nbsp;107]</a></span>
very picturesque situations&mdash;as Godshill on a spur of the
southern downs, Newchurch on a bluff overlooking the
Yar valley, Shorwell nestling among trees in a south-looking
hollow of the downs, Brighstone with its old church
cottages and farmhouses among trees and meadows
between down and sea&mdash;the old and interesting churches,
the thatched cottages, the old manor houses of Elizabethan
or Jacobean date, now mostly farm houses, for which the
Island is famous, add to the varied natural beauty.</p>

<p>One of the most characteristic features of the southern
coasts of the Island, should be mentioned, the Chines,&mdash;narrow
ravines which cut inland from the coast through
the sandstone and clays of the Greensand and Wealden
strata, and along the beds of which small streams flow to
the sea. Narrow and steep-sided,&mdash;the name by which
they are called is akin to <i>chink</i>&mdash;they are in striking
contrast to the more open valleys of the streams which
flow into the Solent on the north shore of the Island. The
most beautiful is Shanklin Chine. The cliff at the mouth
of the chine, just inside which stands a picturesque fisherman's
cottage with thatched roof, is 100&nbsp;ft. high; and the
chasm runs inland for 350 yds., to where a very reduced
cascade (for the water thrown out of the Upper Greensand
by the Gault clay is tapped at its source for the town
supply) falls vertically over a ledge produced by hard
ferruginous beds of the Greensand. Above the cascade
the ravine runs on, but much shallower, for some 900 yards.
The lower ravine has much beauty, tall trees rising up the
sides, and overshadowing the chasm, the banks thickly
clothed with large ferns and other verdure. Much wilder
are the chines on the south-west of the Island. The
cascade at Blackgang falls over hard ferruginous beds (to
which the beds over which Shanklin cascade falls&mdash;though
on a smaller scale&mdash;probably correspond). The chine
above these beds, being hollowed out in the soft clays and
sands of the Sandrock series, is much more open. Whale
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_108" id="Page_108">[Pg&nbsp;108]</a></span>
Chine is a long winding ravine between steep walls, the
stream at the bottom making its way through blocks of
fallen strata.</p>

<p>The cause of these chines seems to be the same in all
cases. It may be noticed that Shanklin and Luccombe
chines are cut in the floors of open combes,&mdash;wide valleys
with gently sloping floors; and at each side of these chines
is to be seen the gravel spread over the floor of the old
valley. It can scarcely be doubted that these combes are
the heads of the valleys of the old streams, which flowed
down a gradual slope till they joined the old branch (or,
rather the old main river)<a name="FNanchor_A_21" id="FNanchor_A_21"></a><a href="#Footnote_A_21" class="fnanchor">[21]</a> of the Yar, flowing over land
extending far over what is now Sandown Bay. When the
sea encroached, and cut into the course of this old river,
and on till it made a section of what had been the left
slope of the valley, the old tributaries of the Yar now fell
over a line of cliff into the sea. They thus gained new
erosive power, and cut back at a much greater rate new
and deeper channels; with the result that narrow trenches
were cut in the floors of the old gently sloping valleys.
The chines on the S.W. coast are to be explained in a
similar way. They have been cut back with vertical sides,
because the encroachment of the sea caused the streams
to flow over cliffs, and so gave then power to cut back
ravines at so fast a rate that the weathering down of the
sides could not keep pace with it. The remarkable wind-erosion
of these bare south-westerly cliffs by a sort of
sand-blast driven before the gales to which that stretch
of coast is exposed has already been referred to.</p>

<p>A few words in conclusion to the reader. I have tried
to show you something of the interest and wonder of the
story written in the rocks. We have seen something of the
world's making, and of the many and varied forms of life
which have succeeded each other on its surface. We have
had a glimpse of great and deep problems suggested, which
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_109" id="Page_109">[Pg&nbsp;109]</a></span>
are gradually receiving an answer. Geology has the
advantage that it can be studied by all who take walks
in the country, and especially by those who visit any part
of the sea coast, without the need of elaborate and costly
scientific instruments and apparatus. Any country walk
will suggest problems for solution. I have tried to lead
you to observe nature accurately, to think for yourselves,
to draw your own conclusions. I have shown you how to
try to solve the questions of geology by looking around you
at what is taking place to-day, and by applying this
knowledge to explain the records which have reached us
of what has happened in the past. You are not asked to
accept the facts of the geological story on the word of the
writer, or on the authority of others, but to think for
yourselves, to learn to weigh evidence, to seek only to find
out the truth, whether it be geology you are studying or
any other subject, and to follow the truth whithersoever
it leads.

<p>Norman's "Guide to the Geology of the Isle of Wight,"
1887, still to be obtained of Booksellers in the Island.
Gives details of strata, and lists of fossils, with pencil
drawings of fossils.</p>

<p>Other books bearing on the subject have been mentioned
in the text and foot-notes.</p>

<p>An excellent geological map of the Island, printed in
colour, scale 1&nbsp;in. to the mile, full of geological information,
is published by the Survey at 3s.</p>

<p>A good collection of fossils and specimens of rocks from
the various strata of the Isle of Wight has recently been
arranged at the Sandown Free Library, and should be
visited by all interested in the Geology of the Island.
It should prove a most valuable aid to all who take up the
study, and a great assistance in identifying any specimens
they may themselves find.</p>
